00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
Here's a use case that may help you envision the benefits of serverless applications,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.130
conserving, compute, and performing efficiently.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.910
In today's hyper-connected and hyper-vigilant world,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.705
many people want a camera watching over their homes and property,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:17.760
and I can understand why.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.885
Images provide context, early warnings, and sometimes reassurance.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:27.020
Imagine a camera pointed at an object to

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.370
see if someone would come and disturb the object in the middle of the night.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.200
Weeks go by and the object is undisturbed.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.225
One night, a figure is captured disturbing the object,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.000
and the camera captures a photo and uploads it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.580
to an S3 bucket that's configured to trigger

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.200
a Lambda function that sends

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.445
an SNS notification to the owner of the object with the image attached.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.555
That's it. That's the serverless app.

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:54.575
I know that was a simple example,

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.120
but the comparison I would like to make

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
here is that in comparison to running the application on

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.255
a server for weeks without any action and paying for all that idle compute,

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:09.905
you can run a simple serverless function and pay literally almost nothing for a simpler,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.745
faster, and less complicated job.

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.810
Now, we aren't yet at the point where

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.335
your average company is running serverless applications in production.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:21.620
As we've discussed, most of them are taking a tentative step

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.355
towards running production applications on EC2 instances.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:30.305
But some of the most technologically advanced companies like Netflix, Blackboard,

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.510
Conde Nast, and The New York Times,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.860
certainly are running serverless applications to great success.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.420
I say that to say,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.260
that unless you're aiming to work for a large multinational tech company,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.375
or cloud consulting agency,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:49.225
don't expect to see too many enterprise level serverless applications for awhile.

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:52.610
It's coming, but it will take some time and

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.645
some baby steps for companies to train, engineer, and test.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.180
The good thing is, when the time comes,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.200
you'll be on your way to flexing your expertise in this new area of computing.
