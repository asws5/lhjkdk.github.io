00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
Have you ever heard of containers? Of course, you have.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.180
Over the last few years,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.180
the concept of containers has risen to prominence,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.580
and most companies are looking at how they can leverage

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.029
container technology to accelerate software development,

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.990
improve operational stability, and save time and money.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.955
The most popular container software as of today is Docker,

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.270
a platform that allows you to build, test,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.300
and deploy applications quickly by packaging software into units called containers.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280
A container includes an application, its configuration,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.835
runtime, libraries, tools, and its dependencies.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:48.455
Containers are portable and because of how the resources are packaged,

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.755
their performance is consistent across platforms.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:55.040
If you need to run a lot of Docker containers,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.400
you need an orchestration or management tool.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.255
Orchestration tools make it possible to start,

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:07.250
stop, and monitor thousands or millions of containers.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.140
Amazon offers three categories of container management tools.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.695
Amazon Elastic Container Registry or ECR,

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:22.195
a container registry that simplifies the storage and management of container images.

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:27.010
Amazon Elastic Container Service or ECS,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.180
and Elastic Kubernetes Service or EKS are fully

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.230
managed services that provide the most secure, reliable,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.015
and scalable way to run containerized applications with

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:44.485
EKS providing the managed service for containerized applications using Kubernetes.

00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:48.755
AWS has two compute options for containers.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:53.330
Fargate is a serverless compute platform for containers,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.575
and of course, EC2,

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:59.170
a scalable compute running on virtual instances,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.575
offering full control of container configuration and scalability if necessary.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:06.910
We're going to focus on fargate.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.210
Another one on AWS's serverless compute engines.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:19.060
Fargate works with both ECS and EKS by managing their underlying infrastructure.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.330
Fargate manages provisioning and allocating the amount of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.215
compute that container services require for their applications,

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.380
while also providing the built-in security inherent in

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.770
the managed workload isolations container services provide.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.665
Running container services in a serverless environment again,

00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:42.770
shifts the work of resource management to AWS,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.090
providing you with an expert partner in the management of your resources,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.100
keeping your applications up and running on

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.455
the right amount of compute at the right scale,

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:55.710
and keeping your container compute costs as low as possible.
