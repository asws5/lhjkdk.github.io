00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.215
So for this exercise we're going to go to a couple of websites.

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:10.095
First, let's go to the AWS Lambda tools pricing calculator.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:14.445
From here based on our assumptions,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:18.390
we're going to enter in the values to find

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
out how much it would cost to run 20 million functions

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.340
with 512 megabytes of memory

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.135
allocated and an estimated execution time of about 50 milliseconds.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:36.960
We're not going to include the free tier because that's cheating.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.740
We find that running 20 million functions per

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.280
month with the following circumstances is going to cost you about $12.34.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.190
Now let's move over to our on demand instance pricing,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.290
and we're going to compare that to an m5.large EC2

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.675
instance that runs at almost $0.10 an hour.

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:07.695
So running at $0.10 an hour 24 hours a day and 30 days a month,

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:11.380
it's going to come out to about $69.12.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.420
Then that's the on demand price.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.795
So if we look at reserved pricing and not paying anything upfront,

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:29.910
that'll be $44.53, and for partial upfront you'd pay $256 down,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.655
and then 21.17 a month.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.355
So that comes out to be about 42.50,

00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:41.675
and if you pay it all at once that's about $500 and that comes out to about 41.75.

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:47.270
So the outcome here is you'll pay between $42 and $44

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.000
for a reserved instance or $12.34 running serverless
