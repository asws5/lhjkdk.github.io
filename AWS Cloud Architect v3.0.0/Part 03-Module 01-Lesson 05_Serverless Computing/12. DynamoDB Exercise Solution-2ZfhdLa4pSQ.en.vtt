00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Here's my solution to the DynamoDB exercise.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:10.470
So I created a table called udacity neighborhood and my primary key is neighbor.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.730
My point in creating this table was to get to know

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
some interesting facts about my neighbors that I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.230
see on a daily basis as I'm walking around and chit-chatting with them.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.200
So here are the names of five of my neighbors.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.530
We can see that this data is quite unstructured.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.465
I'm not capturing data for every field about every one,

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.630
but I'm grabbing what I can and I'm adding it to my table.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.920
So you can see for my neighbor,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.235
Mercedes, I've got her car,

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:50.340
her child, a fun fact about her and what she's growing in her in her first garden.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.229
I see that my neighbor, Hattie,

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.960
there's a fun fact about her, scratch golfer.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.730
She might have a car, she might not.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.230
It's not in the table though.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.870
I don't know anything about kids,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.605
at least I didn't add it here,

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:08.060
but I do know that she likes to go to Whole Foods and what she's growing in her garden.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.860
As you can see, it's these rules are not as strict for unstructured data.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.540
So I've got spaces,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.050
I've got four-by-four, uppercase,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.375
lowercase, and all different kinds of data formatting here,

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.660
even on my primary key, uppercase and lowercase.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.680
In your table, it's fairly easy to make modifications.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.470
If, for example, I do find out at some point that my neighbor, Hattie,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.040
does have a car and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.580
she drives a Ford,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.750
then I can populate that field in the table as well.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.975
So let's go ahead and see if we can find child1,

00:01:56.975 --> 00:02:07.355
which is a string that contains just c,

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:12.775
that should get us cooper.

00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:14.970
That's Raul's child.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.995
But what if we want to pick uppercase C?

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:23.400
That gets us Tracey and her child Charlie.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.145
So when it comes to searching through your table, uppercase and lowercase,

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:30.740
how you enter the data into the table does matter,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.295
unless when you're creating your search terms,

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:36.095
you tell it to ignore case.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:38.850
Thanks for completing the exercise.
