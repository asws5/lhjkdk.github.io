00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Serverless computing is an architectural model

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.465
or a cloud provider offers scalable, flexible,

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.285
and low-cost compute services as needed,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:13.575
eliminating the need for customers to provision and manage compute.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.690
Serverless offers developers the advantage of faster release times,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.630
unlimited compute capacity, and the freedom

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.850
from the task of managing and optimizing servers.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.500
The cloud vendor takes care of all of that,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.465
meaning that in a serverless model,

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:32.510
there are actually servers running behind the scenes,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.035
but developers don't have to interact with or worry about them.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:40.415
Serverless architecture is an excellent choice for new,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:45.115
lightweight, flexible applications that are being designed for the cloud.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:49.565
That is cloud native that have short running processes,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:53.390
inconsistent workloads with levels in between processing,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.090
and a need to reduce latency by having some compute functions running close to end-users.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.020
Not all applications can benefit from running serverless.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.200
Applications that have long running processes and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.140
consistent workloads would probably function best on EC2 instance.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.220
The cost benefit of serverless would be lost on the long running consistent workloads,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.825
which is actually a key metric for an optimized EC2 instance.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:25.145
Serverless pricing is based on resources used per second.

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:28.765
Short functions work best with serverless compute.

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.900
In this lesson, we'll start exploring serverless architecture.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.230
Specifically, we'll talk about cloud migration, AWS Lambda,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.960
serverless costs, API Gateway,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.400
and DynamoDB, and containers.
