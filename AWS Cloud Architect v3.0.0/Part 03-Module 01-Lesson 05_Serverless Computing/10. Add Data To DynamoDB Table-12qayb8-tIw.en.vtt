00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Our table is being created.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
Once it's created, we're going to add some data to our table,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.075
and I'll just show you how flexible our table is.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:14.790
So we go to Items,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
so we're going to create an item in you deci location.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.850
So my idea for this is let's just find out where everyone is.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:34.300
Chicago, I'm going to add another string name, that's me,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.780
and another string,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.045
and we're going to say my role is architect.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:51.410
But since it's a NoSQL database,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.690
we can also just add some random information as well.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.110
So let's just say color,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.930
my favorite color is green and food, ice cream.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.260
Let's go ahead and save that. Look at that.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.660
Let's create another item based on some of this information, but not all of it.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.875
So let's create another item.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.775
So this location is going to be Omaha,

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.160
another string.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.040
Nickname is Bert.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.260
Sport, volleyball,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.975
but also food, beans.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:44.660
So you see this is how unstructured data would look in a table.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.680
So even though we've got a couple of individuals,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.565
we've got all the information for me except my nickname or my sport,

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:53.885
those are still blank,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:56.195
and then we've got another user.

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.520
We don't know what the name of that person is,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.170
but we do know that they like beans,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.755
there in Omaha, and that he liked to be called Bert.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:08.285
So what we can do is we can search.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:15.500
Let's add a filter here where name is a string and it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.120
contains L. There we go, that's me.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.430
So while we're in here,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.775
let's take a look at metrics.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:33.430
These dashboards are provided by default by AWS.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.820
We're going to show read capacity which is pretty low.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.765
We're still 0.02, so we're good on that.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.955
Capacity is coming in pretty low as well.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:49.370
Of course, we only have two items in our tables,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.845
so that's to be expected.

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:57.665
Alarms. Both of them are in OK State,

00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:59.575
and these are defaults.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.690
Again, if you'd like to change your capacity,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.945
your provision capacity, you can do it here,

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:10.400
but I do recommend that we leave auto-scaling off for now until you are certain,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.955
and you have the budget for an auto scale that

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:18.395
could expand possibly beyond your expectations.

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:21.090
All right. Thanks for watching.
