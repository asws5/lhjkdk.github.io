00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Here's what we've learned in this lesson: Cloud migration, AWS Lambda,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.985
serverless costs, API gateway, DynamoDB, and containers.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:16.560
In the next lesson,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.065
we will focus on infrastructure as code,

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.320
creating infrastructure from both the command line,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.155
from a file, and from a module.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.325
We'll look at the why of infrastructure as code.

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:31.390
Why did it come about, and why do we need it?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.760
We'll dive into the benefits of infrastructure as code,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.530
as well as the drawbacks.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.430
Finally, we will explore creating reusable infrastructure.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.250
I hope you've enjoyed learning about Serverless.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's meet over in our final lesson, infrastructure as code.
