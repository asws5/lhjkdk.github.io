00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
In the cloud, we have many options to restrict and control network traffic

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.250
destined to our resources deployed in our private VPC IP space.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.369
This includes EC2 instances, RDS databases,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.015
and other infrastructure services in our AWS VPC.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.890
In order to use these resources,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.800
we will need to allow network traffic to reach them.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.710
Our goal should be to limit this traffic by restricting

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.370
connectivity to specific IP ranges and ports.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.595
This is traditionally done with the use of firewalls.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.685
There are number of ways that we can implement firewall functionality.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:38.680
AWS provides network ACLs that can be applied at a subnet level.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.335
Network ACLs allow you to add multiple firewall rules

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:46.600
that determine whether to allow or deny a connection.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.600
The direction of traffic being outbound or inbound,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.910
source or destination site or block,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.105
or IP and port range in protocol,

00:00:56.105 --> 00:01:00.920
and the order and precedence of processing network ACL rules.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.335
Network ACLs are also stateless.

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.270
This means that for a single connection,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.640
the inbound and outbound rules need to be configured to allow the traffic.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.830
AWS also provides security groups.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830
Security groups are designed to restrict network traffic to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.875
specific cloud resources such as instances,

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.815
load balancers, and database servers.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.010
The security group is applied at the resource level and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.255
not at the subnet level like network ACLs.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:32.900
The security group rule can allow traffic from another security group.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.915
For example, if a rule allows connections on port 80 from security group ABC,

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.635
then any instances that are assigned to security group ABC,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.530
can't connect to the instance with this rule.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.320
Security group rules define allowed traffic.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.690
If it is not allowed, it is denied.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.975
Security group rules do not have an order of precedence.

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.105
Since there are no explicit denies,

00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:00.050
all rules will be evaluated to determine if traffic is allowed.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.435
Security groups are stateful,

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.330
so an inbound connection can be made without needing to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.130
explicitly define an egress rule for the return traffic of that connection.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.220
Host based firewalls allow server admins and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.190
developers to define at the operating system level,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.280
specific inbound and outbound sources and ports.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.645
Similar to network ACLs and security groups.

00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:26.810
Windows firewall, and Linux IP tables are examples of this.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.960
Many endpoint protection products also offer firewall capabilities.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.930
Multiple layers of security are always recommended,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.845
so it is advisable to configure host based firewalls on instances if possible.

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:47.300
Commercial firewall products or appliances can also be deployed in cloud environments.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.650
These appliances offer full fledged functionality out of the box that may

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.665
be desired by an organization depending on network security requirements.

00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:01.445
These products offer a richer set of features, including traffic inspection,

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:03.350
intrusion detection and protection,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.495
Web application firewalls, routing, VPN, etc.

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:12.410
Oftentimes, the complexity and cost of deploying these solutions make it easier to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.815
use the AWS native solutions such as security groups and network ACLs.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:22.010
However, depending on security compliance requirements,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.435
these are powerful tools to have from a network security perspective.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:32.070
Next, we will take a closer look at using network ACLs and security groups.
