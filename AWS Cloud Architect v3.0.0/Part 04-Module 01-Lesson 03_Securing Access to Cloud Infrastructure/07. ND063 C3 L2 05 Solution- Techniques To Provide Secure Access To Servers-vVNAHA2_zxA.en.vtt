00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
In this exercise, the goal was to demonstrate how to securely connect to an instance

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.600
in AWS without requiring local storage or passwords or private key files.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.969
So from our AWS console,

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.910
I'm at the EC2 instances page.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
As you can see, I have an instance that has been launched for this exercise.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.960
Let's check the security group rules to verify that it does

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.260
not allow any incoming connections.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
As you can see, this instance has a security group

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.649
which does not allow any inbound connections.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.625
Now this instance is also set up with an instance profile role.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:37.935
This is the role that's assigned to the instance.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.530
Let's see what permissions this role contains.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.030
So I'm going to open this in another tab and go to the IAM role page.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.480
As you can see, this role has the managed policy,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.510
Amazon SSM managed instance core.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.050
This just allows the SSM agent that's on

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.210
the instance to work with the AWS Systems Manager service.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.825
Now I'm also going to check the IAM role,

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:11.120
which we will use to login to the instance.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.485
So I'm going to use the cand-c3-iam role to login to the instance.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.910
I also check the IAM role which should be used by the user who needs to login.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.870
We want to make sure that this role only

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.460
has permissions to connect to the specified instance that the user needs to.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.270
I've created a sample policy and assigned the policy to the role.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.645
Let's take a look at the policy.

00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:41.240
As you can see, this policy allows the user to start

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.770
a session with the specific instance on my account.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.350
So now let's go ahead and assume

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.140
this role and I can assume the role by just clicking this link.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.465
So this will allow me to switch into that role.

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:58.175
Now that I've assumed the role,

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:00.274
I'm going to use the Systems Manager,

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:03.864
Session Manager tool to login to the instance.

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:07.305
So I'm going to find Session Manager here,

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:13.580
then start a session and this shows me all of the instances that I have available to use

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.215
this tool and choose this as my instance and I try to start the session.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.630
I was successfully able to login to the instance.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.490
So I'm going to go ahead and terminate my session now.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.750
I hope that through this exercise you've become more comfortable

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.380
with a secure method of connecting to your instances running in the cloud.
