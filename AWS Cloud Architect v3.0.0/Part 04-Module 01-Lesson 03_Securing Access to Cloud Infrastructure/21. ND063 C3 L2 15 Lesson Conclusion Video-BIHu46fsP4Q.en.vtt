00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
In this lesson, we have explored a number of different methods

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:07.665
to ensure secure access to Cloud infrastructure and resources.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.560
To recap, we have looked at methods for providing

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.980
secure login access to Cloud hosts and Instances.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.135
We've also discussed the importance of controlling and restricting network traffic,

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.440
including incoming ingress traffic,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.580
outbound egress traffic, and reviewed tools and products to help facilitate this.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.680
We looked at methods for providing

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.050
engineer's secure network connectivity with

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.365
Cloud resources deployed within the Cloud VPC.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:36.005
Finally, we tied it together by looking at

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.020
a simple architecture and having you use some of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.110
the ideas we touched on to make the architecture more

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.605
secure based on a set of connectivity requirements.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.860
I've enjoyed teaching you how to secure your Cloud infrastructure.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.030
See you in the next lesson.
