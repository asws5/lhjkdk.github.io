00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
In this section, we will visit a few common approaches for

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.575
providing console login access to Cloud Instances and Servers.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.440
While providing console access to Cloud Instances

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.995
predicates common actions such as server configuration,

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.995
application deployment, and operations,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.700
providing this access could lead to security breaches in the Cloud.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.355
The first and most common access patterns centers

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.280
around the usage of asymmetric key pairs.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.585
An asymmetric key pair consists of a public key and a private key.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:33.044
When a Cloud Instance is provisioned,

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:37.240
the Cloud provider will add a user's public key to the Instance.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.545
The user will possess the private key,

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.460
which corresponds to the public key.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.265
They can use this private key to authenticate to the Instance.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.350
The biggest risk to this approach is that the end-users are

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.425
responsible for maintaining and managing private keys.

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:54.035
If private keys are compromised or lost,

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:58.180
it can put the environment at risk of unauthorized access.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.460
The second pattern for gaining access to the server is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.064
a situation where passwords are enabled for SSH or RDP.

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:10.970
This is discouraged as it can leave the server open to brute force attacks.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.760
Many Cloud vulnerability scanners will flag this as a misconfiguration.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.530
Earlier in this course,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.010
we discussed IAM roles and identity federation to access the AWS account.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.565
A similar practice can be used for accessing Servers.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:29.130
Using a Privileged Access Management or PAM tool

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.470
with identity federation can improve security by moving

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.960
the responsibility of managing credentials and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.360
user privileges from the user to a trusted process used by your organization.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.670
A fourth method for gaining access to Servers is to use the Cloud Providers Native Tools.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.240
AWS provides the Systems Manager Service which enables

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.560
users to manage EC2 instances at the operating system level.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.485
Systems Manager provides the ability to run remote commands,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:03.499
perform configuration automation, do system patching,

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:07.160
and gain deeper visibility into system configuration.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.865
This is made possible by deploying a systems manager agent on instances under management.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.610
One of the great features that is provided in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.265
Systems Manager is the Session Manager Tool,

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.650
which can provide SSH or RDP

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.470
console access through the AWS console or Command Line Interface.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.890
To use the session manager tool,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.530
a user will authenticate with AWS using their IAM user or role.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.020
The user's role will need a policy that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.315
authorizes them to start a session on the Instance.

00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:43.430
The authenticated user can invoke the Session Manager through

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.300
the AWS management console or CLI tool to obtain a session to the instance.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.955
With this method, no exposure to the Internet is required,

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:56.540
and passwords and private keys do not need to be managed.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.970
As a reminder, it is important to setup IAM permissions with least privilege access to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.145
Session Managers so that users and roles can

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:07.660
only access the systems that they are entitled to.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.800
A fifth method for gaining access to Instances is through an open vulnerability.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.225
Oftentimes, web servers and applications have security vulnerabilities,

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:20.210
which allow users to exploit those vulnerabilities with

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.110
the intention of gaining console access to the Instance.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.995
Finally, the best method to login to Cloud servers and Instances is to not log in at all.

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:33.965
This is called immutability,

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:37.710
and we will discuss it further a little later in the course.
