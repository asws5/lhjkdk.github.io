00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
So far in this course, we have discussed methods to ensure secure,

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:08.925
authenticated, and authorized access to Cloud control plane and server instances.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.430
We emphasized the idea of shifting management of

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.865
users and roles to a centralized identity provider,

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.715
providing least privileged access permissions,

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.915
and designing your environment with the least need to provide access to users.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.440
Inevitably, traffic will need to reach Cloud resources for

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.580
applications to work and to carry out day-to-day operations.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.235
More often than not,

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.770
network connectivity will also be required

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.965
to access entities outside of your Cloud environment.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.230
We're going to look at methods to control and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.545
restrict network traffic to and from your Cloud environment.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:44.420
From a security perspective,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.295
we want to manage the ability to gain network level access to your Cloud resources.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.545
We will call this Ingress.

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.590
Ingress can be required to access services and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.910
resources that are running in our Cloud environment.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.735
By the very definition,

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:03.650
the resources and applications deployed in a public cloud environment are

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.120
generally going to be in a network that is separate and external to a user's network,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.470
be it from an ISP,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.250
a datacenter, or a corporate office network.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.645
A few examples of Ingress traffic are

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:19.750
web application traffic coming from the Internet to your web applications,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.765
traffic coming from other Cloud networks,

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.600
traffic coming from on-premise networks such as

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.020
datacenters or corporate offices for management,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.825
internal user traffic, or other application integration for hybrid Cloud environments.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.835
In addition to Ingress,

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:39.385
we also need to be able to access the Internet or

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:43.450
other external networks for our applications to be able to function.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.500
We will call this Egress.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.160
Common Egress destinations could be integrations with other Cloud-based APIs,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.089
application API traffic to AWS Cloud services,

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:59.185
downloading patches and other system maintenance,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.545
and sending monitoring and metric data to external tools.

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:06.280
In order to keep the environment secure,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.955
it is critical to control and restrict both Ingress and Egress traffic.

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:16.555
Ingress traffic can be controlled and restricted using network ACLs or security groups,

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:19.900
which are both effective firewalls, routing rules,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.150
and host-based endpoint security tools,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.620
which oftentimes contained firewall capabilities.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.555
Egress traffic and AWS is generally handled using Internet gateways and NAT gateways.

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.550
As with Ingress traffic,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.345
Egress traffic should also be controlled and restricted for a number of reasons.

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:42.180
In addition to adding security around Ingress and Egress,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.010
private access to VPC networks is also required either

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.365
from user work locations or from corporate owned network spaces.

00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:54.560
This access is generally provided using VPN tunnels or

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.365
dedicated network links from a co-location datacenter to the AWS datacenter.

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:03.740
In subsequent sections, we will explore some methods and best practices to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.200
ensure that this Ingress and Egress traffic are secure, restricted, and controlled.
