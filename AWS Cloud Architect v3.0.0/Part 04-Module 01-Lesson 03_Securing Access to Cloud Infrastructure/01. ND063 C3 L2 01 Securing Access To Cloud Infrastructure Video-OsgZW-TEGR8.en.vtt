00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
In this lesson,we will discuss security designed around network and server level access.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.675
Previously we discussed security around identity and access management,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.760
which would allow us to ensure that access to

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.960
the AWS console and API was designed in a secure way.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.370
Once we start using this access to provision and use cloud infrastructure,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.780
we will need to ensure that our infrastructure components can only be accessed from

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.295
trusted entities and that access to resources is secure and protected.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.760
A good Cloud security design will incorporate network access

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.215
controls to IP networks provisioned by the Cloud infrastructure customer.

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:42.204
This includes inbound or ingress traffic to Cloud VPC and subnets,

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:45.260
and resources deployed within them such as containers,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.160
Cloud instances, load balanced and database instances.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.620
In addition to looking at inbound traffic,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.980
we also need to look at outbound or egress traffic and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.239
ensure that traffic is not destined to unknown or suspicious entities.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.580
This is key to protecting against data exfiltration.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.520
We will also discuss the ability to log into Cloud instances and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.230
other best practices for ensuring that Cloud instances are accessed in a secure manner.
