00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
In this exercise, you have been tasked with doing

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.560
some independent research on tools that can be

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.400
used to add security controls to an architecture that will have Internet-bound traffic.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.765
As a Cloud architect,

00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:13.680
it is important to be familiar with tools such as these,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.455
and how they can fit into an architecture.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.560
I highly encourage you to read the post that was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.040
shared titled Controlling VPC Egress Traffic.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.440
It is a great starting point outlining

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.180
architectural best practices to effectively secure Cloud network infrastructure.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.540
You should now have a stronger understanding of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.020
how to design network ingress and egress security in the Cloud.
