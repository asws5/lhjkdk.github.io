00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Most cloud native patterns will, at minimum,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.260
tend to use a combination of network ACLs and security groups.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.715
Let's discuss some general guidelines around applying these controls.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.900
Here are some general guidelines for using network ACLs and security groups.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
Know and identify your trusted networks for your source and destination traffic.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.655
Apply ACLs for incoming traffic to all subnets based on trusted networks.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.865
This will typically be VPC to VPC traffic,

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:32.070
on-premise traffic to VPCs,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.610
traffic to subnets which should not be Internet facing.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790
The number of KCLs should be part of the network design of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.265
the Cloud environment and reflect an organization's policies.

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:45.170
The network ACL will act as a safety net

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.080
if instances are deployed with security groups that are

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.310
not tight enough or if

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.310
private application instances or unintentionally deployed to public subnets.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.050
Apply security groups to instances based on

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.154
the role or functionality of that instance or application.

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:05.960
For example, a MySQL database will take connections from application ABC.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.870
The application instances can be assigned

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.190
a security group for allowing traffic to the application port and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.470
the database can be assigned a security group allowing traffic

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.495
from the Application Security Group on the database port.

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:24.395
Both application and database may be assigned a separate security group,

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:28.540
allowing connections from a management subnet for administration.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.700
For both security groups and network ACLs,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.300
following the principle of least privilege only allows traffic from

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.260
specific hosts or IP ranges to specific ports.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.665
The more specific, the better.

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:48.320
Avoid assigning allows all for source IPs like 0.0.0.0/0,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.470
or all for destination ports.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.745
Determine the default security group for a VPC.

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:58.970
Update the security group to not allow any outgoing or incoming traffic.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.485
It should never be used.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:05.105
However, when an instance is provisioned without a specific security group,

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.580
the default group will be assigned.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.390
By now, you should have a decent field for the controls available to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.960
restrict network traffic in a Cloud environment and how they can be applied.
