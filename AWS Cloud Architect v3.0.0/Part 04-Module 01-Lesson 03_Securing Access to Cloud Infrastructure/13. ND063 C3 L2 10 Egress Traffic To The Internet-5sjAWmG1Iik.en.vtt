00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Oftentimes, our applications will need to access services

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.860
on the Internet that are outside of the private Cloud network where they are hosted.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.500
So far, we have focused on restricting traffic,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.625
subnets, and instances using network ACLs and security groups.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.490
These tools also provide us the ability to control

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.045
outbound traffic at the IP address or site or block level.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:26.265
Unfortunately, due to the ever changing and dynamic nature of internet services,

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:31.810
it is impractical to pin down specific IP ranges of the services we need to connect to.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.450
As a result, using network ACLs and security groups to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.470
restrict Internet-bound traffic is not the best approach.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.445
AWS provides a few different ways to connect to the internet from our VPC subnets.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:49.190
Resources deployed in the subset can be assigned to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.065
public IP addresses and will have

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:54.775
Internet-bound traffic routed through an Internet gateway.

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:57.660
A subnet that has Internet-bound traffic routed to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.670
the Internet gateway is referred to a public subnet.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.435
From a security perspective,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.040
it is not practical to deploy

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.050
all application resources that require Internet connectivity into a public subnet.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.215
This widens the attack surface and leaves the environment open to exploitation.

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:18.605
The other option is to use a NAT instance or a NAT gateway.

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:22.025
A NAT gateway can be deployed in public subnets so that

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.920
instances in private subnets can use it to access the Internet.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120
These resources would not be exposed to the Internet.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.090
In this situation, private subnets would

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.570
have Internet-bound traffic routed through the NAT gateway.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.645
Once the routing is enabled through the NAT gateway,

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:42.290
it's generally all or none for Internet traffic depending on

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.900
how outbound rules are set up on the network ACLs and security groups.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.700
The shortfall with the NAT gateway solution from

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.340
a security perspective is that it is difficult to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.195
monitor and restrict traffic at the application layer to specific domains and sites.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:01.940
Next, we will take a look at a few example solutions that will

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.480
provide additional security controls for Internet-bound traffic.
