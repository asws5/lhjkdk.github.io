00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.215
In our previous lesson,

00:00:01.215 --> 00:00:04.800
we discussed access from an identity and permissions perspective,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.560
with respect to the AWS management plane.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.295
When designing and deploying Cloud networks and infrastructure,

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:15.405
there are a few key questions to be asking related to security controls.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:20.155
Which trusted networks will traffic to your Cloud environment originate from?

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:22.835
Determine specific subnets, servers,

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.350
and other infrastructure components that need to be accessed.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.055
Which components in your environment will need network connectivity to other components?

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:32.855
Determine which ports.

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:36.170
An example would be a set of application servers that need to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.060
connect to a database on port 5432.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.600
Our security groups and network ACLs as specific as possible?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
For example, allowing a specific site or block with

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.510
a /16 range is preferred over and allow all site or block.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.805
Which components will be taking traffic from the Internet?

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.890
This is your attack surface.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.040
Can these components be moved to private subnets so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.600
that do not pose a risk of access attempts from the Internet?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.780
How is access to the servers managed?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.175
Are users managing keys and passwords themselves?

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.885
Are the servers hardened to prevent unauthorized access?

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:16.455
Have outbound traffic needs have been identified?

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:21.020
Can applications use private endpoints to reduce the need to access the Internet?

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.900
These are some of the things to think about when designing

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.820
a Cloud environment that needs secure and tight access controls.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.620
Let's start with looking at methods we can use to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.260
gain access to our Cloud instances and servers.
