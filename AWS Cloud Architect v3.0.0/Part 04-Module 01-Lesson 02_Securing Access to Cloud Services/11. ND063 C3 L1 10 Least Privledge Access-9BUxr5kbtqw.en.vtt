00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
When creating IAM policies that provide permissions to users and roles,

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:07.950
we want to follow the common security practice of granting least privilege

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.615
in order to grant only the permissions required to perform the necessary tasks.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.530
Unfortunately, it is a very common practice to allow more permissions than

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.945
necessary for reasons such as convenience or not knowing what permissions are required.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:27.840
Some of the noteworthy recent Cloud data breaches were partly related to users or roles,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.420
which were compromised and then the attacker used

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.290
the overprivileged permissions to ultimately gain access to sensitive data.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.445
Previously, we discussed best practices around securing IAM access for users or roles.

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:46.040
However, there will always be a risk that temporary credentials are compromised.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.240
For that very reason,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.570
it is critical to fine tune IAM policies to restrict and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.260
limit at minimum what actions can be done,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.335
what resources those actions can be invoked on,

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:02.990
which principal or who can execute the action,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.340
and any additional conditions that are needed.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.590
For example, requiring MFA to be enabled

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.980
or allowing calls from specific source IP addresses.
