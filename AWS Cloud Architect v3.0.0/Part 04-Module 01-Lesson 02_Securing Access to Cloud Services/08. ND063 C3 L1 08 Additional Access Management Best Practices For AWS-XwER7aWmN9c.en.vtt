00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Now, that we've explored methods to use AWS,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.095
IAM roles to help secure access to AWS services.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:12.855
Let's go over a few additional best practices to secure access to your AWS account.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.630
The root user of the AWS account is

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.810
the e-mail address that was used to create the account.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.720
This user has full control of the account and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.440
its credentials should be treated with the highest sensitivity.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.040
Multi-factor authentication or MFA should be set

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.640
up and in the hands of a trusted member of your organization.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.860
The password should be stored in

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.250
your organizations secrets management store with the highest sensitivity.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.400
Never create API credentials for the root user and avoid

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.940
using the root user for anything once the account is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.240
created and the initial setup has been performed.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.960
When dealing with IAM users and roles enforce

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.085
strong password policies and MFA for all users.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:02.780
As discussed earlier, API keys should be avoided as much as possible.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.025
Ensure that keys are rotated regularly if they have to be used.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:12.280
Ensure that IAM users and roles are reviewed and audited on a regular basis.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.340
Audit permissions granted versus actions executed based on

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.485
CloudTrail audit logs and other tools which assess access needs for a user.

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:26.530
Remove users and roles which have not been used recently and no longer needed.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.180
If IAM users are being used,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.090
do not assign IAM policies to users,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.815
instead, use IAM groups to designate permissions based on a group that a user is part of.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:43.860
Next, we will take a look at using identity federation in the Cloud.
