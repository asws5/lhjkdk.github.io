00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
The goal of this exercise was to get a feel for tuning an IAM policy.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.320
If you didn't complete all of the actions correctly, that's okay.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.345
We just wanted you to get a feel for the interface and how some of these tools work.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:20.670
In this exercise, you would have successfully created an IAM policy that would fulfill

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.625
the access requirements of an application

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.120
and ensure that the application had least privilege access.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.800
If things went according to plan,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.765
you would have created an IAM policy that looks something similar to this.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.185
Let's look at the policy a little deeper.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:39.410
The first statement provides permissions to get the list of buckets and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.880
get some basic information to be able to view the S3 console page.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.540
The second statement allows you to list the bucket contents, however,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.895
it restricts you to listing the specific bucket that you need access to.

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:56.060
The third statement will allow object operations, such as uploading,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.640
downloading, and modifying object properties,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.250
but only for objects in your bucket.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.530
Finally, as an added safety net,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.340
we added an S3 deny on the get object call for all other buckets.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.590
This protects the data in other buckets even if

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.355
another more permissive IAM policy is added to this role,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.090
we want also ensure that the role has been updated to only have

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.100
the least privileged IAM policy that was created for the exercise.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.210
The more permissive policy that was there initially should have also been removed.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.600
You should have also tested the role and policy by attempting to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.595
list or download objects in other buckets in your account.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.265
I'm confident that through this exercise,

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.600
you'll have a better idea of what it takes to start

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.420
fine-tuning IAM policies for your applications
