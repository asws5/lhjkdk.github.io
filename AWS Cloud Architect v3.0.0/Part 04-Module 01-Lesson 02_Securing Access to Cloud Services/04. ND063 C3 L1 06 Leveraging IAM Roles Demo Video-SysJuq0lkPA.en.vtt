00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
I'll walk through a quick example of this in action with

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.860
an application that we'll use in IAM roles to access AWS services.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.580
As you can see, I'm logged into my AWS account

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.185
and I will use the Management Console to demonstrate setting up an IAM role.

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:21.045
First, I'll go into IAM and create a new IAM role.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:26.595
The IAM role will be used by an application running on an EC2 instance.

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.165
This is also called an instance profile role.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:35.040
I will choose EC2 as the service that will be able to use the role.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.755
This effectively defines who we will trust assume the role.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:46.435
As you can see, other services such as Lambda can also be trusted to assume the role.

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:49.880
We can also allow other AWS accounts,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.070
web identities, and SAML 2.0 identity providers to assume this role.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.760
Now let's define what actions that this role has permissions to perform.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.860
We will choose an existing policy that provides the role full permissions to S3 for now.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.040
I'm also going to assign my role of policy which will

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.250
allow me to log into the instance to test the application.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.530
I'm going to give the role name, and I'm going to create the role.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.860
Now that I've created the role,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.835
I'm going to assign the role to my application server instance.

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:33.910
So I'm going to go to the EC2 dashboard and find my application server.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.340
Here I have my application server running, and right now,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.290
it does not have a role assigned to it,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.670
so I'm going to assign the role.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.215
This is the role that I had just created.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.475
So now that instance has the role attached,

00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:54.440
I'm going to go ahead and login to the instance using

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.460
Systems Manager and use the Session Manager feature to open an SSH session.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.630
From here, I will attempt to make calls to the AWS API.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.580
The application, in this case,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.025
will be the AWS CLI application.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:14.200
However, this can apply to any application code running on the instance.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.655
Because the instance is assigned the role,

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:20.840
I do not need to use any explicit API keys to make my calls.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.565
So first, I will call the API to list my S3 buckets.

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:31.145
So I've successfully been able to list my buckets that I know that the role is working.

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:37.050
Next, I'll try to create a simple text file that I can write to a specific S3 bucket.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.410
So I'm going to copy this text file and upload it to,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.520
I'm going to choose this last S3 bucket, udacity-cand-c3-l1-walkthrough bucket.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.600
Copy the bucket name, and there it is.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.910
I was successfully able to interact with the AWS API using an instance profile role.
