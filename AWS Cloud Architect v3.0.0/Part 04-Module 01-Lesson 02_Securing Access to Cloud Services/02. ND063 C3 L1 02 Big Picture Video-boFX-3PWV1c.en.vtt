00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lesson, we will get a better understanding of the Cloud Access Model and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.125
discuss the importance of authentication and authorization in the Cloud.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.560
Controlling and restricting access to

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.720
the AWS management plane or API is done through the IAM service.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.465
This is the overarching first step in Cloud security.

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:24.120
Provisioning, configuring, and accessing Cloud resources and data is achieved

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.815
via the API through the AWS console or CLI for users,

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.500
and AWS SDK for applications.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.080
Authentication refers to who can sign in and use the API.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.220
Authorization refers to what permissions that user has.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.535
A very secure authentication model can prevent credentials for being misused.

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:49.580
A well-designed authorization model ensures that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.005
the ability to perform malicious behavior is very limited.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.105
Securing access to this API is arguably

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.470
the most important piece of the Cloud security design.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.984
This is because with the correct permissions,

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:06.080
an actor can make the necessary changes needed to open the network,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.285
access and decrypt sensitive data,

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.355
disable logging and traceability,

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.835
or modify access privileges.

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:17.240
It would not be inaccurate to say that traditional security controls such as

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760
network firewalls and data encryption can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.970
be sidestepped with the right access to the API.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.420
Suffice to say, all other security controls in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.720
AWS depend on a tightly managed IM strategy.
