00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
In this lesson, we covered the importance of

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.775
the right identity in access management strategy in the cloud.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:08.490
The foundation of provisioning, managing,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.585
and accessing cloud resources starts with identity and access management

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.640
and the ability to control access to the AWS APIs or the AWS Console.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.610
We covered the criticality of reducing the use of

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.820
IAM users and API keys by instead leveraging

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.250
roles which allow you to provide access to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
applications and users without providing permanent API keys.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.810
We also emphasized using identity federation to

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.200
improve security of AWS environments by ensuring

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.810
that user and role management is moved to

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.910
an organizational level and outside of the AWS environment.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.015
Lastly, we looked at least privilege access,

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.780
an important yet often overlooked safeguard for ensuring that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.090
compromise credentials lead to the least possible consequences.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.450
I highly advise you to look at your current AWS usage and start

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.230
implementing IAM best practices right away as oftentimes,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.745
they're an easy fix with the least impact on architecture in applications.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:11.690
Become familiar with AWS documentation around IAM,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.150
especially the best practices section.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.530
Look into advanced concepts such as attribute-based access controls,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.460
or using the access analyzer.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.250
See you in the next lesson.
