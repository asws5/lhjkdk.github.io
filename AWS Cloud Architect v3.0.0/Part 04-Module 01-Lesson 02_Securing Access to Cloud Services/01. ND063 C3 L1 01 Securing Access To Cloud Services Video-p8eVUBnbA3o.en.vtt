00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
In this lesson, we'll be covering

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.260
best practices and strategies to ensure that access to Cloud,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.400
data, and services is locked down and secure.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.260
We will highlight the importance of

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.230
a well-designed access model and how it can

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.545
contribute to protecting from various security threats.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.125
Our focus in this lesson will be on examining

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:25.110
Identity and Access Management capabilities within AWS or IAM for short.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.850
We'll cover Cloud security best practices around managing access to the AWS Cloud,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.935
with a focus on managing users, roles, and permissions.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.635
By the end of the course,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.340
you will have a greater understanding of how to use IAM roles to provide

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.925
secure access to both users and applications that need to use AWS services.

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:51.425
You'll get a chance to walk through security best practices such as identity federation.

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:57.304
You will also be introduced to fine tuning access permissions for least privilege access.

00:00:57.304 --> 00:00:59.690
Securing access to Cloud services is

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.915
an incredibly important topic when designing for security.

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:05.430
I can't wait to get started.
