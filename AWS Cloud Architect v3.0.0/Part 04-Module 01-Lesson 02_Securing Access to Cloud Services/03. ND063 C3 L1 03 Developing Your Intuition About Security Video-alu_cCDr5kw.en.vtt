00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
As a cloud architect,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.585
you should be able to look at in architecture or

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:09.105
AWS account and determine any holes or gaps related to access control.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:14.055
What are some of the key questions to ask around identity and access management?

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.860
First and foremost, we need to be asking how

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.580
users are managed in the AWS accounts we are working with.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.065
Is there a central trusted identity that is going to manage user provisioning,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.725
deprovisioning, credential enforcement, and role segmentation?

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:34.080
Or are different teams managing user access disparately with a loose process?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.150
Is identity federation in place,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.860
so that the organization as a whole governs which users are part of which roles?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.770
Are processes in place at an organizational level to ensure that when

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.750
a user no longer needs access than

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.065
their accesses are revoked from all cloud environments?

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.420
Are users part of the correct groups,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.070
allowing them to have permissions to

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.595
only those actions that they need to do for their role?

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:01.750
Are the permissions for these roles fine tuned to be the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.450
least privileged in order to reduce the blast radius?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.660
Are we using temporary credentials, one-time passwords,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.490
or multi-factor authentication for all layers of access?

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.820
My approach to start thinking with the security mindset is to ask yourself,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.660
what if credentials of the user were to be stolen or compromised?

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.340
What's the worst that can happen?

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.135
In order to have a good sense of how secure you have designed the environment,

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:30.740
make sure to identify areas of your infrastructure and architecture which would be

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.750
vulnerable to data loss or other malicious activity in the event of unauthorized access.
