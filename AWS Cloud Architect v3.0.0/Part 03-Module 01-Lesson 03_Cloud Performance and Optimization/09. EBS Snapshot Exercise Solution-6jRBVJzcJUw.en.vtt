00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
Let's take a look at the solution to the exercise where we created

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:08.055
a snapshot of an EBS volume from a running EC2 Instance.

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:13.050
So let's go to EC2 here under the Management Console,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.020
making sure that I'm in Northern Virginia, of course.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.000
I can go to Instances,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.495
I'm going to launch an Instance.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:32.865
Amazon Linux configure details at storage,

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.720
eight gig general purpose SSD,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.670
I'm going to go ahead and launch.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.195
So let's wait for our new Instance to launch.

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:57.690
Great, so we've got instance that's up and running in a Northern Virginia region,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.035
us-east-1, an availability zone b.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:02.820
So we've got our instance running,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.320
what we're going to do now is we're going to stop our Instance.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.550
While we're stopping it, let's just make a note of the Instance ID so we can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.960
identify it under our Elastic Block Storage Menu.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.360
Normally what I do is I just look at the last six or so characters.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080
So we've got 90c0fd.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.350
Now let's browse over here to volumes and we're looking for

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.780
the eight gig GP2 volume that's attached to 90c0fd.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.045
So that is the top volume here.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.100
Under actions, we're just going to create

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.260
a snapshot and we're going to call it another database backup.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.915
This environment is going to be our dev environment,

00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:04.910
and we're going to create a snapshot,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.040
which is just basically a backup of

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.170
our development database that's running on

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.420
that Instance or that was running on that Instance.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.039
Just want you to know that you don't have to stop an Instance to create a snapshot.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.540
But in this case,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.240
because I did stop the Instance,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.800
that would be an indication that I'm going to attach

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.590
a different Instance or something of that nature.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.080
So to attach or detach an Instance,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.024
again, select an attach and detach.

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.690
So thanks for completing the exercise.
