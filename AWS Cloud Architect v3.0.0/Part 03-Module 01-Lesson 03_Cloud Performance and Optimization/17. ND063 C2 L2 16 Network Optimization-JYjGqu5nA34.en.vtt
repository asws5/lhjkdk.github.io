00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.215
In AWS, the network is virtualized, flexible,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:10.015
and configurable making it easier to select a networking solution that meets your needs.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.065
In our previous modules,

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:17.625
we've become familiar with some of the services AWS provides to assist with networking,

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:21.270
such as network optimized EC2 instances,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.320
S3 transfer acceleration, and CloudFront.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.940
In the Cloud, networking is absolutely critical.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.845
Without a functional network,

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:33.570
there is no Cloud.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.960
The network is also the first place people look when

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.725
an application is slow, inconsistent, or unreachable.

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:45.170
One of the challenges of the cloud is that there is part of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.015
the network that is public and completely out of their control.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.089
ISPs have outages and maintenance,

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.560
that doesn't have anything to do with the Cloud providers.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.750
But at the end of the day,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.540
it affects the end-user experience.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.000
What Amazon has done over the years is built out infrastructure and services to improve

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.150
their own internal network performance to mitigate and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.815
reduce network challenges that may be out of their control.

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:16.640
Here's some ways AWS has implemented service performance improvements.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.015
While we can't go in depth on all of these services,

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:24.450
it's pretty important to familiarize yourself with the names and what they do.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.720
Amazon S3 content acceleration,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.325
lets external users like your customers,

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:36.454
use the networking optimizations of CloudFront to upload their data back into S3.

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:40.480
Amazon I3 EBS-Optimized instances

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.250
provides some extra dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS IO,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.600
which greatly improves the performance of your EBS volumes by reducing

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.115
competition for bandwidth between EBS and the rest of your instance traffic.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:59.415
Latency Based Routing, or LBR for Route 53,

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:02.860
improves your application's network performance by routing

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.865
your customers to the AWS endpoint that provides the fastest experience.

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:10.790
AWS Direct Connect provides

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.800
dedicated connectivity from the on-premises network to the AWS environment,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.280
giving you consistent bandwidth for your cloud applications to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.645
connect easily and perform to your expectations between environments.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:29.855
Amazon VPC endpoints provide reliable connectivity between AWS services like

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:33.050
S3 without requiring them to go back out to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.205
the network or internet and come back into AWS.

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:39.529
When you use a VPC endpoint,

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.840
the data between your VPC and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.330
another AWS service is transferred within the fast and reliable Amazon network,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.790
eliminating your dependence on the internet or other external network.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.040
AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.820
the availability and performance of your applications by providing

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.130
static IP addresses as fixed entry points to your application end points by using

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.215
the AWS global network to optimize the path from your users to your applications.

00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:14.275
It monitors the health of the endpoints and when it detects an issue,

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:17.425
it will redirect traffic to healthy endpoints.

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:20.290
When implementing a scale out architecture,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.155
where you want to use multiple instances for service content,

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:28.615
you can leverage load balancers inside your Amazon VPC.

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:34.730
AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the elastic load balancer service.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.624
The network load balancer is a service that is optimized to deliver your content,

00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:42.640
be the fastest route available both during times of

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.675
instability and across geographical region.

00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:53.420
Application load balancers are best suited for load balancing of web traffic and assigns

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.730
load based on the performance attributes of

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.835
your running code and not necessarily the traffic or load on your server.

00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:06.470
Network load balancers are best for balancing TCP traffic and are

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.690
capable of handling millions of requests per

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.295
second while maintaining ultra low latencies.

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:17.975
They're also optimized to handle extreme and unstable traffic patterns.

00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:21.539
Classic load balancers are still available,

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.420
and they perform the familiar task of distributing incoming network traffic across

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:33.120
multiple EC2 instances and as many availability zones as you require for performance.
