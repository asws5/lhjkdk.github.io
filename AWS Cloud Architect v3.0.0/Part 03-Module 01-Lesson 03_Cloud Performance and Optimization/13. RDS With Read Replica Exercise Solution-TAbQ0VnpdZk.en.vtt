00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
Let's walk through creating a database with a read replica.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:09.760
So first, let's make sure we're in the right region.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.480
I recently visited RDS,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.950
but just for the example,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.970
we're going to type in RDS here and follow it from the search bar.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.440
It's going to bring up the RDS console and we could create an Aurora database here.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.240
But instead, let's go to database,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.190
this over here in the menu.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.050
To create a database,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.060
it's going to give us a couple of options.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.630
Let's go with easy create and we're going to easy create

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.170
an Aurora database with my SQL compatibility,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.245
a Dev/Test, which is going to be pre-configured for r5 large instance size.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.930
Let's call our database,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.505
AuroraMySQL01-1, so that's going to cluster identifier,

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:13.370
master username admin, we'll go ahead and let AWS auto-generate a password for us.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.730
That's fine. Once the database is created,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.705
it'll give us the password in a pop-up window.

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:20.860
We can copy it from there.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.030
We'll go ahead and create our database and our database is creating.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.460
It might take a little while.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.090
Again, here's where we can see that auto-generated password that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.110
AWS created for us by clicking view credential details here.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.970
So again, it tells us this is the only time we can view this password,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.710
this a onetime Window.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.970
So you'd want to copy this password and keep it in a safe place,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.950
and then once your database is up and running,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.140
you can go in and modify it or you can add other users, e.t.c.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.010
So let's just go ahead and close this,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.560
databases is still creating.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.170
Once our database is created,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.120
we're going to create a read replica by going to add reader.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.300
Awesome. So now that we've got our database cluster created,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.010
we saw that this instance changed from reader to writer.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.855
So we don't have a reader anymore because that was one that was being created.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.705
So we're going to go select our cluster,

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.290
go to actions, and add a reader.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.525
This is adding a read replica to our cluster.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.875
Same class availability zone.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.830
This, I'm going to leave it at no preference,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.900
but you can select the availability zone.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.525
In the Northern Virginia region,

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.145
these are the availability zones that are available.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:57.890
So I'm going to say no preference and let AWS like that for me,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.785
not going to be publicly accessible,

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:06.120
and let's just call this reader 1.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.510
No preference for priority.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.670
Keep all the default options.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.320
I'm not going to enable enhanced monitoring for this replica.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.875
I don't want to spend the money,

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:21.105
and performance insights, same thing.

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:22.565
A version upgrade.

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:27.215
This is a few half database where he don't mind if AWS

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:32.765
update your database with minor engine upgrades,

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:35.600
but if you have a database where you can't change anything

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.945
without going through a change control and even for a minor update,

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:40.400
you'd want to select No here.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.490
But I'm going to go ahead and select Yes just because they're going to keep it simple,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.015
and we're going to add our read replica.

00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:53.000
This is going to take a little while here as well and soon

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.190
we'll see that we're going to have

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.325
another database with a role of reader here in the list.

00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:04.360
There we go. Our read replicas is right here, reader 1.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.059
So thanks for following along and I'll see you at the end of the next exercise.
