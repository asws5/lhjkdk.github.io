00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Although an EBS volume is usually attached to an EC2 instance when it is created,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.840
it's highly durable and can be detached and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.950
exist separately independent of an EC2 instance.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.945
EBS volumes can be created when an EC2 instance is created,

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:22.935
or separately on the EBS management page.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.475
EBS volumes can be attached to and detached from

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.150
instances and can be used just like any other hard drive.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.740
You can run databases,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
create file systems, and move them between instances as required.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.550
You pay for the storage you provisioned whether it's attached to an instance or not.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.880
So be mindful of idle EBS volumes and make

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.395
sure they're needed before you maintain them for long periods of time.

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:50.600
A lower-cost alternative, is creating a snapshot of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.725
the idle EBS volume and storing it in S3 to be restored if later you find it necessary.

00:00:56.725 --> 00:01:02.025
AWS EBS provides four storage volume types.

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:06.885
Two solid state drives and two hard disk drives.

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:10.860
The first, is provisioned IOPS SSD,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.995
then general purpose SSD,

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:19.825
Throughput Optimized HDD, and Cold HDD,

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:26.050
with hard-disk drives coming in 2-3 times less than solid state drives.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.700
Solid-state drives provide single digit millisecond latency for

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.525
transactional workloads like databases where performance depends on IOPS.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:42.050
Hard-disk drives are for high throughput workloads where the drive is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.015
expected to process large amounts of data measured in megabytes per second.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:51.065
Let's take a look at creating a snapshot from EBS volume.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:55.710
So the EBS volume and it can be found under EC2.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.190
Once we get here,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.840
we're going to scroll down to Elastic Block Store and Volumes.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.660
You see we have four volumes currently active in this account.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.295
We're going to create a snapshot of the volume on top,

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:14.900
the first volume here.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.310
So we're going to select it,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.580
go to actions, and create snapshot.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.815
The description of the snapshot,

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:25.160
let's call this db backup,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.325
and we're going to say the environment is production,

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:37.860
and we'll go ahead and create our snapshot.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.560
We've got a successful message,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.185
and once we've created our snapshot,

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:50.495
we can find it under the snapshots option in the EBS menu.

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:53.605
We see that we have one snapshot here,

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:58.310
100 GiB drive called db backup that was completed today.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.250
That's how you create an EBS volume snapshot.
