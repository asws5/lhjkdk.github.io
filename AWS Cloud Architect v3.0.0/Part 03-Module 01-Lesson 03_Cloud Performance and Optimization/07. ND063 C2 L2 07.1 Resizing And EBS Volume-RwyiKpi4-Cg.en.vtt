00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.650
So first what I'm going to do is quickly create a free EC2 instance,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.225
free tier, configure the details.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:17.940
I'm going to accept the default eight gigs of storage and just go ahead and launch it.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.900
Here's my existing key pair, launch my instance.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.260
So let's check out my instance id here, i-04c0.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.555
That's enough for us to find the block storage attached to my instance.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:36.370
So while that's on its way,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.880
let's browse on over to EBS volumes and sure enough,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.040
here's the storage, the eight gigs of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.805
storage that's attached to the instance I just created.

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:54.255
Let's go back here really quick and see how it's doing.

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:58.020
Great, it's running, so we're all good.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.825
Coming back over to our block storage volume,

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:11.800
going to expand my storage by modifying it and making it 12 gigs,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.385
we need a little bit more capacity here.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:21.175
So adding more storage.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:25.175
Now, because this is a Linux backed AMI,

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:27.485
we're only halfway there.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:32.615
We actually have to let the file system know that we've added that extra storage.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.915
So let's go back to instances.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.360
I'm going to go ahead and connect to it.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.849
One of the easiest ways to SSH into an instance is to come to connect

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:51.065
and then let's go ahead and copy this here and paste it into our terminal.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:56.985
So we're going to SSH into instance,

00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:03.535
yes, and this has to be done with some elevated permissions.

00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:06.780
So we're going to elevate ourselves to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.230
root and first let's check it out and see what we have here.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.500
Run this command.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.080
So we see that even though we have 12 gigabytes,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.240
our partition is still sitting at eight.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.830
So we're going to run the growpart command on

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.215
our partition and it looks like we're good.

00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:36.695
Let's just run and check one more time and see lsblk

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:42.885
and make sure that our partition has been allocated the extra four gigs.

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:46.635
Yeah, it looks good. So let's exit out of that.

00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:49.570
Get out of here.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.455
Let's go back over to our volumes and sure enough,

00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:02.370
our size has been increased. Perfect.
