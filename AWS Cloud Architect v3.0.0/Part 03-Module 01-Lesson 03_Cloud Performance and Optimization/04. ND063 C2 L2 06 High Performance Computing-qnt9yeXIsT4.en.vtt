00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
High-performing infrastructure and performance

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.575
optimization is not to be confused with high-performance computing.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:12.960
The term high-performance computing has come to generally mean aggregating

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.210
computing power in a way that delivers

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.710
much higher performance than one could get out of a typical computer or server,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.305
in order to process data and perform complex calculations at high speeds.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.500
High-performance computing is essentially the use of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
supercomputers for complex computational problems.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.205
The terms high-performance computing and supercomputing can be used interchangeably.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.855
High-performance computing or HPC

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:45.965
is an aggregate of technologies such as computer architecture,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:49.100
algorithms, electrical engineering, and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.150
software under one paradigm to solve the world's biggest problems quickly.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.625
An efficient HPC system requires a high bandwidth,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.920
low latency network to connect multiple nodes and clusters.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.260
One of the primary drivers for moving to the cloud,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.330
especially in research, academia,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.750
and finance is high-performance computing.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.040
Running high-performance computing workloads in the cloud allows for

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.700
rapid innovation and also the on-demand and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.025
unconstrained scaling that cannot be achieved with mixed server clusters.

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:29.194
The advent of supercomputing is responsible for recent advances in medicine,

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:33.155
finance, conservation, virtual worlds,

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:37.040
and machine learning, taking workload processing from days and

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.335
weeks to hours and minutes and bringing what once seemed impossible to reality.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:47.430
Amazon offers optimized instances for supercomputer clusters capable of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.675
the computational and graphics processing required for high-performance computing.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:56.600
Running high-performance workloads on AWS provides

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.705
the flexibility of a single console for global access to high-performance clusters.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.720
You as the customer,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.690
can take advantage of all the hallmarks of AWS infrastructure and technology;

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.665
pay for what you use, elastic infrastructure,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:17.275
flexible configurations, and optimized network operations.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.990
While this class is not going to teach you about supercomputers,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.740
it's important to understand the difference between high-performance and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.780
high-performance computing and how AWS offers end-to-end support for both.
