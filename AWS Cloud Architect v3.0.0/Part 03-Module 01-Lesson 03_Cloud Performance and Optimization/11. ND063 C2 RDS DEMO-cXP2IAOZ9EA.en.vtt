00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.224
Right now, we're going take a look at creating an RDS database.

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:05.550
So in AWS management console,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.800
we're going to make sure we're in the right region,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.695
and we're going to go ahead and look for RDS in the search, find it, click,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.180
and what we're going to do next,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.465
is create an Aurora database with MySQL compatibility.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.990
Then from there, we're going to go ahead and create a read replica.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.720
So let's create our database.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.030
We're going to do a standard create which is going to

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.235
take us through all the configuration steps.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:37.740
Easy create just uses the recommended best practice configuration and it's really quick.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.685
So let's just walk through the steps here.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:43.355
We're going to have an Aurora database with MySQL compatibility,

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.690
one writer and multiple readers.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.940
Our production database is going to be a little bit more costly than dev and test,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.670
obviously because of high availability and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.475
fast consistent performance as it's described here.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:59.845
Let's give our database cluster a name,

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:07.700
UdacityCloudDB, and allow AWS to create a password for us.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.395
When the database is creating,

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:12.200
a pop-up is going to appear that we can click on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.140
and AWS will provide us with that complex password.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.650
A memory optimized instance is fine, multi-AZ deployment.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.735
We're not going to create a replica this time,

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.925
we're going to do that manually in the next step.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:30.309
Default VPC is great and we're going to go ahead and create our database.

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:34.480
While it's doing that, we're going to go ahead and click here.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.405
This is the first and last time that AWS will show us this password,

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:45.665
so you want to make sure that you make a note of it, copy it,

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:51.770
and paste it into some a database management tool, whatever you choose.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.185
As we can see UdacityCloudDB is in a creating status.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.790
So we'll give that some time to create.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.520
Let's refresh it, see where we are in the process.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.035
So our cluster has been created and it's just creating our instance.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:20.285
Great. Successfully created our database.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:25.970
So thanks for watching and we'll see you in the creating a read replica demo.
