00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.395
Here's how I created my network diagram with AWS VPC.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:11.505
We want an Internet gateway, an EC2 instance,

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:16.140
and a public subnet with an elastic IP address and the database in

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.710
a private subnet and some a client to connect to AWS.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.290
So I'm using Lucidchart,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.200
which is an online diagramming application.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.485
I think you have a free trial for a couple of weeks,

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.325
but I went ahead and paid for the full version.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:38.745
So Lucidchart has some AWS icons integrated.

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:45.215
I went ahead and pulled those up to prepare myself to create this diagram.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:50.465
So here first, we're going to drag over the

00:00:50.465 --> 00:01:00.100
AWS cloud large environment here.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.065
Lucidchart provides some guidelines but let you know when you've got it centered.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:12.500
So I'm going to give myself plenty of room here to build out this little network diagram.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.995
Second, I'm going to bring in a VPC.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:22.550
Try to get that as centered as I can and make that nice size too just so I

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.940
can have some room to add as needed.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.310
Okay. I want a VPC to that.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.380
I'm going to add an availability zone in my VPC.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.870
You got nice size too.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.785
We're going to have to put a couple my subnets in here.

00:01:54.785 --> 00:02:03.540
I'm going to need subnet one.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.845
Let's get that to decent size.

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:11.380
Grab another subnet here,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.130
get that, bring that little bit.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.805
Maybe make that one a little bit bigger.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:29.740
So we want to put a database in our private subnet,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:38.850
and we want to put an EC2 instance in our public subnet.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.435
Bring that down a little bit,

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:45.180
make it a little smaller so it fits in there a little better.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:58.835
Goodness. Diagramming takes a little bit of time to get used to,

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:01.890
but I'm sure you guys will get it.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.810
Moving you up now so we don't have as much crowding.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:18.720
So let's scroll down a little text box here.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.320
Then we're going to call this our public subnets.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.425
Let's make it so that we can see it.

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:34.570
Then let's do that again for our private subnet.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.165
We want to add an Internet gateway.

00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:45.310
Let's find that Internet gateway,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.920
and so had them here.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.420
It's pretty big, shrink it down a little bit.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:09.075
Let's add a workstation to access everything here.

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:13.350
I'll make that a little smaller too.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.480
That's probably good enough.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.480
Let's connect it. Well, let's bring this down to

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.420
the gateway and let's bring you up a whole and connect it to our client.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.120
Okay. I think that's good enough.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.210
Let's see. So I hope you were able to come up with something similar here.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.980
Let's attach our gateway to our public subnet here.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.400
Let's see. I built one earlier, let's compare them.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.805
An elastic IP address, that's what we forgot.

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:11.160
So let me get our elastic IP and add that here.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.565
We'll call that good.

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:26.320
We can make it a little bit [inaudible] and maybe we'll make our VPC a little bit better.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.965
If you're able to complete this exercise, congratulations.

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:34.310
I know diagramming isn't the easiest concept if you're not accustomed to it.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.940
So thanks for completing the exercise,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.170
and hopefully you [inaudible] up with a diagram that looks a little something like this.
