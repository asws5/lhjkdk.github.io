00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
The user experience is one of the most important factors in

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.355
maintaining a successful application with satisfied customers,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.760
especially when it comes to delivering media such as videos,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.080
music, and immersive games.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.950
As a Cloud architect,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.165
improving the online experience will be one of your top priorities.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.395
In the world of 8K video, 3D games,

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:28.745
and applications where users transmit video story experiences to millions of followers,

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:34.070
leveraging a content delivery network can be the answer to user satisfaction.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.480
Content delivery networks are systems of distributed proxy servers and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.950
data centers that deliver media and other web content to a user,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.685
based on geographic location.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:48.290
Content delivery networks cache

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.745
popular content in multiple points of presence close to the user,

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:57.740
so that the user's request can be retrieved from the local cache and serve more quickly,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.520
than retrieving it from the origin location.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.695
CloudFront is Amazon's content delivery network offering,

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:10.035
serving content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:14.525
Edge locations are located in most major cities around the world,

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:20.255
and their proximity to users cuts down on latency and increases user satisfaction.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.810
The increased performance and availability is due to keeping

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.610
frequently requested objects cached in edge locations worldwide.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.999
CloudFront accelerates content distribution by using the AWS network backbone.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.375
Taking advantage of the existing AWS network

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.735
reduces the number of networks the request must pass through,

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:46.030
providing much higher transfer rates than using public networks.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.730
When a user requests content served with CloudFront,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.470
the requested content is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.970
delivering the content with the best time performance.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.305
When a user requests content,

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:04.250
if the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.860
CloudFront delivers it immediately.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.520
If the content is not yet in the closest edge location,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.475
CloudFront retrieves it from a predefined origin,

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:16.640
like an Amazon S3 bucket or a web server that you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.645
identify as a source of the original content to the edge cache,

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.855
and then it delivers it to the user from the cache.

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:27.920
The origin server can be configured to add headers to the content,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.515
to indicate how long you want the files to stay in the edge location cache.

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:38.715
By default, the file stays in an edge location for 24 hours before it expires.

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:41.825
The minimum expiration time is zero seconds,

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:45.480
and there isn't a maximum expiration time limit.
