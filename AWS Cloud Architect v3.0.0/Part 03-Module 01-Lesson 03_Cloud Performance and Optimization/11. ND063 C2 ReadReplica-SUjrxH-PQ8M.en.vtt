00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
Amazon Read Replicas are additional database instances,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.770
created from a snapshot of the source database.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.320
Read Replicas are asynchronously

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.845
updated when there are changes made to the source database,

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:18.210
and they are available in AWS, RDS for MySQL,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.745
MariaDB, PostgresSQL, Oracle, and AWS Aurora.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:28.665
Read Replicas provide improved performance for read heavy database workloads,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.840
by allowing read-only connections,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.469
and that's reducing traffic to the source database,

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.405
and freeing the source database to carry out

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:38.770
other resource intensive database operations.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.550
Read Replicas are good for

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.925
database applications that have intensive reporting requirements,

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:46.640
like Business Intelligence or financial engines.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.300
Because they transfer the intensive queries away from the source database,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.150
and provide results faster,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.820
and if necessary, a Read Replica can be promoted to

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.040
become a standalone database instance in a disaster recovery scenario.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.474
So now that we've created our new database cluster in instance,

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:09.020
udacitycloudlabdb, we're going to add a Read Replica to the instance.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.165
So we're going to select our cluster,

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:15.520
and under Actions Add reader,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.610
no preference for A-Z,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.780
obviously not publicly accessible,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.950
and let's give it a name,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.690
udacitycloudlabreader, and we'll say tier zero,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.610
which means if there's a fail over,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.815
then this reader will have the priority,

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:39.510
even though it is the only reader,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.125
that's fine, and performance insights, no.

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.030
By saying yes to maintenance,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.815
this means that we're going to allow AWS to do

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:52.280
database instance engine updates if they're

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.175
minor automatically without us having to intervene.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.630
So let's go ahead and add the reader,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.900
and give it a couple seconds here.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.825
Hit "Refresh", so our reader is here,

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:11.715
Read Replica and it's creating status.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:18.875
Let's just stay here for a few minutes until we have our reader available.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:23.520
So I'm going to refresh it here in a couple minutes and see what we got.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.590
So let's take a look at our reader.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.980
We will see that now it's in the status of configuring enhanced monitoring,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.435
so it's almost finished,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:36.110
and we'll notice that it's in a different availability zone than the writer.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.395
So the writer is in US East 1C,

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:41.465
or Northern Virginia 1C,

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:45.130
and our reader is in US East 1D.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.980
It's almost finished here.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.510
Let's hit "Refresh" one more time here to see if

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:03.150
our Read Replica is available. Thanks everyone.
