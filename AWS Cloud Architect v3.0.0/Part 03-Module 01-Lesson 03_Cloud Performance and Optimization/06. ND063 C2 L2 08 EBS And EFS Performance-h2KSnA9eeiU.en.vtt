00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Amazon EBS, or Elastic Block Storage,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.670
is provisioned capacity and performance,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.880
meaning you are paying for the EBS storage even if

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.460
it is unattached or has very low read and write activity.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.320
One of the first ways you can optimize your EBS performance is

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.560
by making sure you don't have provision storage that's not in use.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.640
Occasionally, you will need to audit your environment

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.505
to detect and delete obsolete EBS volumes,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.855
and adjust the size of your provision storage to match your actual use.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:38.115
EBS volumes attached to EBS optimized instances can be accessed using dedicated networks,

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:42.540
whereas non EBS optimized instances use shared networks.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.080
Of course, dedicated network connections to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.230
storage provides increased throughput options.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.460
Non EBS optimized instances share the network with all the rest of the local traffic.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.160
You will need to evaluate your application to determine if using

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.625
an EBS optimized instance would provide a benefit,

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.490
especially if your application is web-based or

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.630
clustered and see significant network traffic.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.790
Your application performance can be limited

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.080
by the network bandwidth available to your instances.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.590
This is another reason it is important to perform extensive tests when developing

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.965
your applications to determine the best instance for your specific performance needs.

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:27.560
EFS volume performance optimization is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.085
built into the service because it already is distributed,

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:35.195
making it highly available, durable, and scalable.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:42.260
Amazon EFS can be mounted on up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances concurrently.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.625
If you can parallelize your application across more instances,

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:51.335
you can drive higher throughput levels on your file system across those instances.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:55.655
Applications that perform a large number of read and write operations

00:01:55.655 --> 00:02:00.490
likely need more memory or computing capacity that applications that don't.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.685
Once again, when benchmarking your application and development,

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:07.400
choose the EC2 instance types that have

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.450
the resources that your application needs for optimal performance.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.515
Amazon EFS supports two forms of encryption;

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:19.045
encryption in transit, and encryption at rest.

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:22.520
Choosing to enable either or both types of encryption for

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.800
your file system has minimal effect on IO latency and throughput.
