00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
High-performing infrastructure configurations take

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.690
time to develop and the work is really never done.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.930
Over time, new technologies and approaches become

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.395
available that can improve the performance of your workloads.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.505
When you take a data-driven approach to making configuration decisions,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:20.130
you will find that there is always an optimization,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.450
a modification, or an upgrade available that can save time and money,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.455
improved performance, and increase user satisfaction.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:33.485
Taking a thoughtful approach to performance optimization involves monitoring,

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:37.235
testing, and reviews based on your benchmarks,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:39.940
and ultimately your production goals.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.085
The data will lead you to choose the best resources,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:48.110
services, and configurations, for your applications and infrastructure.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.455
So here's what we covered in this lesson.

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:57.740
Scaling to meet performance needs, storage optimization options,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.355
archiving for optimal cost and performance,

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.550
database performance optimization,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.689
message queues for application decoupling and buffering,

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.780
and networking for minimal latency.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.640
In the next lesson,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.445
we're going to dive into serverless computing.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:19.790
We will explore the three fully managed services that

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.060
you can use to build and run serverless applications;

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.860
AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
