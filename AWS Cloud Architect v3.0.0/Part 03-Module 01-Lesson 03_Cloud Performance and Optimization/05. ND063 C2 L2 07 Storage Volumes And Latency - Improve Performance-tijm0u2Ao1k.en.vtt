00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
As discussed in the previous lesson,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:06.630
Amazon has three broad categories of storage services,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.845
object, block, and file storage.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.815
Each option meets a different storage requirement,

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.530
allowing you to be flexible and selecting and finding

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.980
a solution that works best for your storage scenarios.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.245
S3 is Amazon's highly durable, general-purpose object storage.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.215
S3 works great for unstructured data,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.985
such as media content,

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:33.570
static HTML files, and archived documents.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.600
Amazon S3 provides the highest level of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.680
data durability and availability on the AWS Cloud.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.355
AWS guarantees 11 nines of availability,

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:53.680
or 99.999999999 percent availability of files on S3.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.945
There are three tiers of S3 storage,

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:58.925
one each for hot,

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.085
warm or cold data,

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.725
otherwise known as S3 standard,

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.595
S3 IA and glacier.

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:12.755
Elastic Block Storage volumes are the durable block storage attached to EC2 instances,

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:17.320
use for data that requires long-term persistence and quick access.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.005
There are two types of block storage, solid state drive,

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.940
SSD storage, and hard disk drive or HDD storage.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.390
SSD block storage offers two options, general purpose,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.100
an EBS provision, I-Apps,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520
SSD for latency sensitive workloads.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.990
Unlike S3, block storage needs to be provision in advance,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.800
so you pay for it whether you're using it or not.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.160
Elastic file system provides simple,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.320
scalable file storage for use with EC2 instances with the capability of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.995
scale from gigabytes to petabytes of data without needing to provision it in advance.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:03.245
Amazon EFS is designed for workloads and applications such as Big Data,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:08.230
media processing workflows, content management, and web serving.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:15.470
EFS is designed to provide parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.380
enabling your applications to achieve high levels of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.225
throughput and I-Apps with consistent low latency.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:28.670
Optimizing S3 performance involves scaling your connection request horizontally,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.995
or in other words, making multiple concurrent requests to S3.

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:37.280
There is no limit to the number of connections you can make to your S3 bucket,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.100
and S3 isn't a single endpoint or a library of data sitting in one location.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.755
It is a massive distributed system,

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:48.650
so spread your requests over separate connections to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.505
maximize the accessible bandwidth from Amazon S3.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:56.675
S3 buckets are stored in the region you select when you create it.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:03:01.115
So whenever possible, access the bucket from Amazon EC2 instances

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:06.440
in the same region to reduce network latency and data transfer costs,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.495
and make a use of

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:11.750
AWS S3 transfer acceleration for

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.055
fast and secure transfer of S3 files over long distances.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:20.465
Transfer acceleration uses Cloud front edge locations.

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.940
When the data reaches an edge location,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.650
it is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.280
Use transfer acceleration for transferring gigabytes to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.805
terabytes of data regularly across continents,

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:39.850
or when you need to upload to a centralized S3 bucket from anywhere in the world.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.805
AWS also has a storage service called instance store,

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:47.570
which is a femoral storage attached to an EC2 instance.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.720
It is only viable during the lifetime of the instance,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.335
and is deleted when the instance is terminated.

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:55.325
As we discussed earlier,

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:59.345
Amazon also has storage optimized EC2 instances,

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.970
or instances designed for workloads that require

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.610
high sequential read and write access to very large datasets on local storage.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.954
For more information about storage optimized instances,

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:14.790
I've included a link in the further research below.
