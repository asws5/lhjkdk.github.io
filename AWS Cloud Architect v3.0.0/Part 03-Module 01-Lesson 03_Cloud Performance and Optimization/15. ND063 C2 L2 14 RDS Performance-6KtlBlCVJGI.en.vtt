00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
AWS RDS offers a wide range of database instance classes for higher performance,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.515
including our familiar M class memory optimized instances,

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:13.545
and T family burstable instances.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:16.485
Of course, you can elastically scale your instance

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.395
up and down as needed to improve performance.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.460
You can start small and grow based on your workload.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.919
Using CloudWatch to monitor your database resources and based on the metrics you capture,

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.590
you can test and scale accordingly.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.375
RDS also takes advantage of AWS Elastic Block Storage or EBS,

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:39.875
for exceptional read-write performance.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:43.530
You have the same SSD or HDD options with

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.525
general SSD or provision IOPS SSD or magnetic hard drive storage.

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:52.600
But we aren't going to consider the magnetic option in a performance discussion.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.275
We're going to assume design for optimal performance and cost.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:00.215
So we'll assume the use of EBS solid state drives.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.960
We have general purpose SSD,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.265
which is the default general SSD drive with linear scaling and burstability.

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:11.615
We also have provisioned IOPS SSD,

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:13.190
which is fast, predictable,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.765
and consistent when you need fast and consistent I/O.

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:20.735
Provision IOPS SSDs are also more costly,

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.485
so you pay for the increased performance.

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:28.020
Database backups and maintenance windows affect database performance.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740
While your database will still be fully available,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.350
I/O will increase, and that may have an effect on performance and production.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.275
Of course, this is something you can predict and prepare for.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:44.600
AWS RDS provides automated read replicas for all databases,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.380
except for Oracle and SQL Server.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.230
These read replicas scale out read performance by

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.320
replicating all changes made on the master databases to read replicas.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.869
Read replicas are fully managed service,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.205
and to reduce cost associated with cross availability zone traffic,

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.935
you should configure the Multi-AZ feature

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:09.850
to specify where the read replicas should reside.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.500
In addition to CloudWatch and the metrics that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.215
can be monitored and alerted on in that service,

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:19.795
AWS now offers a service called RDS Performance Insights.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:22.910
A database performance tuning and monitoring feature,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.450
you enable in the RDS console that helps you quickly assess

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.820
the load on your database and determine when and where to take action.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.220
The output from performance insights is displayed on the Performance Insights dashboard.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.565
This feature isn't overly technical or complicated,

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:43.834
and the dashboard makes the database load easy to understand and interpret,

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:47.935
suitable for the experienced DBA and the IT generalist.

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.375
For example, when the load is high,

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.459
it is easy to identify the bottleneck,

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.060
be it CPU consumption or a misbehaving SQL statement.
