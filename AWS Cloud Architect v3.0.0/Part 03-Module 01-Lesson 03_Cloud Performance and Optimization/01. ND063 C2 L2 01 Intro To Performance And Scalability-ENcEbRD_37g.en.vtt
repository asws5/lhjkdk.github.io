00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.845
Performance issues don't just go away after you migrate your applications to the cloud.

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:10.725
Especially if you employ the Lift and Shift Model of Cloud Migration, or Implementation.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:13.860
You will find that most of the time your performance

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.860
issues are related to your application, or service.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.170
Resolving the issues would require

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.245
a code redesign for the application to be cloud native,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.200
or at the very least to be compatible with

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.520
modern cloud services which are designed for Performance Optimization.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.695
But what if it isn't your code?

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:34.260
What if it's your cloud configuration,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.645
the one that you came up with?

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:42.380
In this lesson, we will explore ways to utilize AWS services to optimize performance.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.415
When your metrics indicate adjustments are necessary.

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:49.520
Because performance, and cloud resources are so closely related to cost,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.070
and resource allocation, monitoring,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.570
and managing cloud performance is a high priority for cloud architects.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.935
We are going to uncover how best to architect for performance from the start,

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.300
as well as how to detect,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.024
and improve performance degradation,

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:07.460
and compute storage, and the network.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.640
AWS, offers a variety of internal services that help customers by monitoring performance,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.605
and analyzing performance trends to offer insight as to how to improve performance,

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:20.810
saving time, and money.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.925
Specifically, we'll talk about scaling, storage,

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:34.990
archive, database, message queues, and networking.
