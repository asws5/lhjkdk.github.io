00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
When it comes to running applications in the public Cloud,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.420
companies are very concerned about security.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.535
This is justifiable and a very valid concern shared by many.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.845
So the questions will always arise,

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.155
will my data to be secure in the Cloud?

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:21.575
What about the major data breaches that I've heard in the news in the last few years.

00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:25.160
How do I know the underlying physical hardware is secure?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.275
These questions can be answered by

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:30.950
understanding the shared security responsibility model.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.850
In the shared responsibility model, the Cloud provider,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.240
for example, AWS, is responsible for security of the Cloud.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.680
The Cloud customer, on the other hand,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.930
is responsible for security in the Cloud. What does this mean?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.530
So let's take a look at a representation of this model

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.135
from the AWS Security and Compliance page.

00:00:55.135 --> 00:00:57.890
This page has a great diagram

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.495
describing this model and I'm going to open it up in another tab.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.930
So AWS is responsible for protecting

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.540
the physical and virtual infrastructure that

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.350
runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.130
This infrastructure is composed of hardware, software,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.335
networking, and the facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:24.860
An example of this would be AWS's commitment to ensure that

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.400
one customer can never access another customer's database or network resources.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.555
The customer, on the other hand,

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.850
is responsible for ensuring that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.259
Cloud services they use are configured and accessed securely.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.180
An example of this could be when a customer provisions a Server Instance.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.510
They will be responsible for operating system hardening

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.575
on the server and ensuring that disk volumes are encrypted.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.874
The customer is also responsible for determining

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:59.000
identity and access permissions for the specific resource.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.855
As a consumer of Cloud infrastructure and platform services,

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:06.350
you have the power to apply security best practices to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.490
ensure that the Cloud is a safe and secure place to run your applications.
