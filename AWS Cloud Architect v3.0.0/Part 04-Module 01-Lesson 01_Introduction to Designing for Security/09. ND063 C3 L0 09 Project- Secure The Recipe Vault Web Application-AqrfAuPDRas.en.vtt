00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
In this project, you will deploy an application environment in AWS

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:09.240
and apply methods learned in the course to secure and harden the application and data.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.680
Designing and deploying applications in the cloud with security in mind is critically

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.960
important since a breach can have wide ranging and devastating impacts on any business.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.925
You will play the role of a cloud architect for an online store, MomsKitchenTo.u,

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.700
and be responsible for ensuring that secret recipes stored

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.690
in the cloud are secure and protected from unauthorized access.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.835
The environment will be deployed initially with minimum security controls in place.

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:43.225
You will assess the architecture design and apply and test various security controls.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:45.230
This project will also give you

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.950
additional experience deploying infrastructure as code templates,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.010
and simulating a common breach scenario in

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.250
order to appreciate some of the security controls that are covered.
