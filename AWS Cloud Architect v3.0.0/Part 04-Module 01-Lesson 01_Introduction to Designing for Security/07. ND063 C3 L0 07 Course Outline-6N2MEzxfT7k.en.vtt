00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.115
In this course, we will be focusing around

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:05.755
architectural best practices around Cloud security.

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:10.680
We will start with looking at Identity and Access Management in AWS.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.980
We will cover techniques to ensure that users enrolls who

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.805
manage and control resources in the Cloud are secure.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:22.125
We will also investigate best practices around authentication,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.860
authorization, and fine-tuning user permissions.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.860
We will also explore methods of ensuring that

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.645
your cloud infrastructure and networks are protected from unauthorized access.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:39.105
This will include techniques to secure and harden access to instances and servers.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:44.380
Additionally, we will delve into network controls offered by the Cloud provider.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.390
You will also get an overview of various methods to securely connect to Cloud networks.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.460
Once we have a good understanding of how to secure access to Cloud environments,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.980
we will cover techniques and methods related to protecting data stored in the Cloud.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.490
We'll look at encryption capabilities offered by

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.980
AWS and how applications can leverage these capabilities.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.955
I will also provide recommendations around encryption key management.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.480
Finally, we will tie it all together by looking at how

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.140
to incorporate security in your Cloud operational model.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.710
We will introduce the idea of shifting security

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.615
monitoring to the left in order to discover risks early on.

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:33.980
We will also look at tools to discover vulnerabilities and insecure configurations.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.080
Finally, we will discuss some of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.090
the AWS Cloud services which can defend Web applications from external threats.
