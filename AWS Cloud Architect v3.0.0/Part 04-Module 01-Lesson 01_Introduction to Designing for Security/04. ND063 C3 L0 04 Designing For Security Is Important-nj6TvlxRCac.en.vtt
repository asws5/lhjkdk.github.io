00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
So why is this course important?

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.845
Why do we need to ensure that our cloud environments

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:07.800
are architected with security in mind?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.870
The answer boils down to trust.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.890
Businesses that lose the trust of their customers will not be able to survive.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.490
In an online world, customers trust businesses to ensure

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
that their personal information and any other data is secure and protected.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.200
Looking at some statistics from 2019,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.599
courtesy of IBM Security,

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.935
the average cost of a data breach is on the order of millions.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.065
This tells me a few things.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:39.005
First, the cost of a data breach is devastating to a business.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:44.660
Second, it appears that in addition to securing their applications and infrastructure,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.650
companies are faced with a very real challenge in being able to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.015
identify and remediate vulnerabilities or compromises to their environment.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:57.814
In the cloud, securing applications and infrastructure is important,

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:01.730
but security monitoring and operations are equally as important.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.010
For this reason, everyone using the cloud,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.230
from developers and architects to DevOps engineers need to have a firm grasp on

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.960
cloud security practices and how they can be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.110
implemented early on in the design and development phase.
