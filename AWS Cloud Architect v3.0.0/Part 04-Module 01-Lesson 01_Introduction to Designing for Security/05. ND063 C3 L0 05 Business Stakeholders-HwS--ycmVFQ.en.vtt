00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Companies that develop and build applications

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.590
running in the Cloud will need to ensure that teams are

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.960
trained in all aspects of Cloud architecture and engineering, especially Cloud security.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980
Developers and architects will all be responsible for ensuring that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.510
Cloud services they use are designed and developed with security in mind.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.720
DevOps engineers will need to ensure that security is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.690
introduced into the infrastructure build pipeline,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.400
early on, and that Cloud environments remain secure post-production.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.080
Information security teams that are seasoned in securing systems will also

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.699
benefit from being aware of Cloud-specific security capabilities and architecture.
