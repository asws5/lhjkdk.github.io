00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.335
In the recent past,

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:03.540
companies and governments have been adopting

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.480
the usage of the Cloud at a lightning-fast pace.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.385
The past few years have seen massive migrations of workloads into the public Cloud.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.450
Data centers are being closed and vacated right and left.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.570
Many organizations have a Cloud first mandate in place for all new applications.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.240
With the rapid adoption of the Cloud,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.180
we're also seeing a rise in Cloud related security breaches.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.390
Well-known brands such as Facebook, Instagram, Accenture, Verizon,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.030
and CapitalOne are just a few companies that have been affected in the last few years.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.540
As I mentioned earlier,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.625
the impact can be huge in dollars,

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.165
impact to users, and public image.

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:45.560
Many of these breaches were a result of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.295
simple misconfigurations to Cloud storage or servers.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.630
In this course, we will introduce you to valuable steps you can take to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.770
prevent these misconfigurations and reduce the risk of a breach.
