00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.725
Hi, my name is Mehdi and I'm excited to be your instructor in this course.

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:07.350
I join you today as a Senior Cloud Architect

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.050
and Consultant working out of the Chicago area.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.065
I help companies large and small build,

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.305
deploy, and run their applications in the Cloud.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.345
For the past five years,

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:22.860
I have focused almost exclusively on working with development and engineering teams to

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.950
architect and operate Cloud infrastructure and services using Amazon Web Services.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.195
For many reasons, it's an exciting time to be working in Cloud.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:37.500
The speed and agility provided by the Cloud allows companies to move fast,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
easily change direction, and focus on products and features.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.555
On my journey, I have seen these benefits firsthand.

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:48.215
Unfortunately, the reality is that there's also certain risks,

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.940
especially on the security side,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.890
that need to be considered.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.520
I've developed a passion for helping users of the Cloud reduce

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.215
this risk by evangelizing Cloud security best practices and principles.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:05.610
I look forward to sharing my experience and knowledge with you during this course.
