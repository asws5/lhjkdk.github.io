00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
In order to participate in the exercises and the project,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.090
you will need access to an AWS account.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.095
Your user should be set up with Console and programmatic access.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.510
You will also need a Git client in order to

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.420
interact with the repositories used in the project.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.675
I recommend you also installed AWS CLI,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.565
as you will need to run commands against your AWS account for some of the exercises.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.595
Finally, in some of the walkthroughs,

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:31.575
I have made use of certain tools which have been run on a Linux-like command line.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.405
In order to follow along,

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.165
set up an environment with Terraform 12.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm confident you have these set up if you've

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.370
completed the previous courses in the nanodegree.
