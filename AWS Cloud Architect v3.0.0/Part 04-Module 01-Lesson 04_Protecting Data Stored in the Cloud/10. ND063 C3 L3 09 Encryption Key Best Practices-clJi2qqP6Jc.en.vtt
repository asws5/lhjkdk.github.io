00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Now let's move on and look at a few best practices around

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.945
managing customer master keys or CMKs.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.805
Key policies are the fundamental method to control access to keys.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:17.100
Use key policies to explicitly restrict the following where possible,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.745
allowing certain IAM roles to manage keys,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.640
enforce the presence of MFA for

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.620
management action such as changing the key policy or deleting keys,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.370
allow certain IAM roles or users to use the keys for

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.095
cryptographic operations such as decryption or encryption,

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:42.145
restrict specific AWS Services to be allowed to use the key.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:46.220
For example, we can restrict a key to be only used for

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.330
decrypting S3 objects by an application.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.085
However, that application will not be able to perform decryption actions on DynamoDB.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.000
When a key is created,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.055
the default key policy will allow the following: the ability to

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:09.905
allow IAM policies outside of KMS to provide permissions to manage or use the key,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:13.850
the ability for selected IAM principals to manage a key,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.985
the ability for select IAM principals to use the key for cryptographic operations,

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:23.150
and the ability for certain IAM principals to grant

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.635
permissions to AWS services to use the key.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:31.580
In most cases, the default key policy is sufficient with slight modifications

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.570
depending on the need for other IAM users or accounts to be able to make use of the keys.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.960
When using IAM policies to allow access to KMS keys,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.440
continue to apply the principle of the least privilege.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.230
Policy should only grant users, roles,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.405
and applications access to only the keys that they require.

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:57.395
Audit and monitor calls to KMS and events related to customer master keys.

00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:00.964
Using monitoring services such as CloudTrail and CloudWatch,

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:06.280
you can be aware of events generated by the KMS service related to management in usage.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.110
Examples of this would be being notified of

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.680
keys scheduled for deletion or auditing key usage.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.330
Enforce encryption of resources where applicable.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.000
Using IAM policies, ensure that policies assigned to users and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.090
roles only allow the creation of a resource if it is set to use encryption.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.580
Resource policies, such as on S3 buckets can be set up with

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.240
bucket policies only allowing write of objects with server-side encryption enabled.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.960
Also enforce real-time monitoring.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.730
Use Lambda functions or AWS Config to immediately identify

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.865
resources that have been created without these mandated encryption settings.

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:52.970
Key management is critical to ensuring the security of your data.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.250
AWS provides capabilities within the KMS service to help architects and developers

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.190
ensure that keys are managed securely in

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.715
accordance to an organization's compliance requirements.

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:08.270
We've illustrated some of these high level capabilities and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.690
we'll round it up next with the walk-through of key management in action.
