00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
Encryption is fundamental when it comes to security.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.090
Ensuring the data is encrypted at all levels,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.730
at rest and in transit is crucial when it comes to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.445
designing both infrastructure and applications.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.580
The criticality of data encryption is magnified in

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.910
the public cloud environments such as AWS because

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.180
the underlying physical infrastructure and hardware is shared

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.125
with other tenants and managed and owned by the Cloud provider.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.560
Infrastructure teams need to ensure that storage

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.200
that will store data leverages encryption capabilities.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.840
Development teams need to ensure that applications encrypt

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.865
sensitive data prior to persisting to the underlying storage.

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:43.580
Protecting and managing encryption keys and certificates is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.595
a major component of every organization's information security program.

00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:54.275
Although risks can be reduced by tightening controls around cloud networks instances,

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.360
and identity and access management,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.580
the risk still exists.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.090
Ensuring data is encrypted at all layers further

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.935
reduces the risk of data falling into the wrong hands.

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:09.770
The risk of data falling into the wrong hands can be reduced by

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.790
tightening controls around Cloud networks and instances,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.509
identity and access management,

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.290
and ensuring data is encrypted at rest,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.220
further protects your data and it reduces the risk

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.340
of data being usable by those not entitled to see it.
