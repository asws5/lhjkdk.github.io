00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
In this lesson, we have highlighted methods to ensure that data stored

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.245
in Cloud environments is protected from unauthorized access.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.100
We walked through how an application may use encryption keys to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.525
ensure that data is encrypted when written to disk or Cloud storage.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:18.900
We then took a closer look at the S3 service to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.290
understand common encryption methods and capabilities.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.740
We also explored some of the options and capabilities for

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.270
key management using the AWS Key Management Service or KMS.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.220
Finally, you were able to put some of the concepts into practice to demonstrate how

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.080
encryption keys can be managed and

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.435
segregated and utilized between two different sample applications.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.420
You should now have a better understanding of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.930
capabilities to protect data stored in the Cloud.
