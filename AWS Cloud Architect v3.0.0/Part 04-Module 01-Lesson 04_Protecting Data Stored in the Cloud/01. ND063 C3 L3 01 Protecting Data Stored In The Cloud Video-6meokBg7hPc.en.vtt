00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
So far, we focused on controlling and restricting access to

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.945
Cloud management plane and Cloud infrastructure components.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.465
Looking at it from a security perspective,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:11.610
the goal was to minimize the risk of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.169
a malicious actor being able to access our network and servers,

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.435
invoke the AWS API,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:24.015
and ultimately perform destructive or unauthorized actions in our environments.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:26.085
Going one step further,

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.430
it is crucial that the data we are storing in the Cloud is

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.075
encrypted and that the encryption keys are correctly managed.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:40.400
In the event that they were to be a vulnerability to our network or AWS account settings,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.140
we want to reduce the risk of data being readable by an unauthorized party.
