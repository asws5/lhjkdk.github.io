00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's look at some of the key high-level questions that need to be

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.600
asked when designing or assessing a Cloud environment.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
An architect needs to be able to identify all application code and

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.840
services that will be run in an environment

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.750
that will be persisting data to Cloud data stores.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.290
This includes the use of data volumes, file shares,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.320
object storage such as S3, RDS,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.830
and other database storage, Elasticsearch and more.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.450
Determine how sensitive the data that is being stored in the Cloud is.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.315
Your organization should have

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:35.750
data classification standards that will allow you to identify and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.425
tag Cloud components so that components storing sensitive data are easily identifiable.

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:45.905
Determine who needs access to encryption keys in order to encrypt data,

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.845
decrypt data, manage key permissions,

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.160
and destroy or rotate keys.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.380
Many design choices in the Cloud will hinge on

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.780
specific regulatory or organization compliance policies around data encryption.
