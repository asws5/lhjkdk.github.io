00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
We're going to talk a little bit about this hybrid Cloud diagram.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:09.225
But first, I'd like to discuss the diagramming application that I used to create it.

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.060
So this is lucidchart.com.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.060
You can use Lucidchart with a free account which

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.270
allows you to save a couple of files for free.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.374
When you create your diagrams in Lucidchart,

00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:27.284
what's important is that you search for and find the AWS shapes.

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:29.400
To add the AWS shapes,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.205
you want to click on this gear icon and search for AWS in the search bar.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:43.205
It brings up some network options and architecture for 2017,

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:45.905
2019 and network infrastructure.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.690
So depending on your preference,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.900
when you take a look at the icons and see which one you like more,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.270
you can select "Icons" and make those available over

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.180
here in the left menu to use as you create your diagram.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.230
Let's take a look at a diagram of a hybrid Cloud environment.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.200
So in this environment, we have two public Cloud providers,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.485
we've have got AWS and we've got GCP.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.600
At the top here, we also have the corporate data center.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.850
Both of these Cloud environments are connected to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.119
the corporate data center through a VPN connection.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.500
On the AWS side,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.370
you see we have a VPN gateway that's managed on the AWS side by

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.480
the AWS Cloud architects and network engineers and the corporate gateway,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.750
which is going to be managed by the on-premises network engineers.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.510
Those gateways are secured via

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.890
their local protocols and connected via a secure VPN connection.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.150
This environment allows the Cloud to share

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.580
data and resources with the corporate on-premises colo data center.
