00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
As you've probably figured out by now,

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:07.065
managing the costs of cloud computing is a complex but very important topic

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:12.015
required for any organization interested in maintaining good cost controls in the cloud.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:16.470
It's one of the skills that makes my job as a cloud architect so interesting.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.290
My goal in this lesson was to give you an introduction

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.915
to the complexities of AWS service costs,

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:27.585
and an overview of some of the important issues you'll face when procuring AWS services.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.345
Here's what we covered in this lesson.

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:33.465
We've learned about the AWS approach to cost

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.380
associated with providing managed services in their public cloud.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.320
In comparing costs between the traditional or physical server model,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.870
we've explored how cloud costs really can't be compared because

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.065
public cloud compute capacity is built as a utility and not a capital asset.

00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:54.920
It was a shift in thinking that led us to a deeper understanding of AWS regions,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.360
and the reasons that costs in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.400
different geographical areas very significantly based on location,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.944
government regulations, utilities, and the costs of doing business.

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:11.989
We proceeded to dive into the cost of AWS services like EC2 Instances, storage,

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:16.370
and databases, and how being mindful of the opportunities to reduce

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.170
costs up front can save you and your organization substantially over time.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.625
When you commit to AWS with reserved Instances for EC2 and databases,

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:29.555
and we commit to a life cycle for S3 objects as well.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.460
Finally, we explored how

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.465
skilled cloud architects optimize their cloud infrastructure with the help of

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.380
AWS services and even some third party tools to reduce

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.805
costs and unnecessary power consumption when they monitor and right size.

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:45.245
In our next lesson,

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:47.690
we will dive into how AWS services can be

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.590
optimized to get the best performance out of your workloads in the cloud.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.480
We'll also look at high-performance computing and how AWS provides services

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.799
and technology for large computing problems in industry and academia.
