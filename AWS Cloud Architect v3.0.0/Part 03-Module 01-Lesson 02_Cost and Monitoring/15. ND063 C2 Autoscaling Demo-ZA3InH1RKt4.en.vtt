00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
Now let's take a look at EC2 Auto Scaling.

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:05.775
So to get to EC2 Auto Scaling,

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:12.400
we're going to click on EC2 under recently visited services or we can search it here,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.530
in the search bar and select it there.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.155
Once we get to the EC2 console,

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:29.310
we're going to scroll all the way down to Auto Scaling and click on Auto Scaling groups.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.235
One thing I want you to notice before we move forward with Auto Scaling groups,

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:37.490
is that we have a message here in the EC2 console from

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.030
Amazon saying that the EC2 console is being redesigned.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.490
When you log in to AWS from time to time,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.530
you're going to see messages like this.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.550
It's just them updating and modernizing and changing things around based

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.995
on feedback and the modernization of the application.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:59.850
So what we're going to do is we're going to launch the Auto Scaling group wizard here.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.015
Here's a new design for EC2 Auto Scaling also.

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:07.580
So basically they're saying that this is an older console,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.255
it's being replaced with a new Auto Scaling console.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.570
But for now, we're just going to click on create Auto Scaling group.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.255
There's two steps, create

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:21.560
a launch configuration and then the second step is creating an Auto Scaling group.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.705
So let's get started.

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:27.290
We're going to select the EC2 instances.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.810
We're going to select Amazon Linux and our free tier.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
Going to name our Auto Scaling launch configuration,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.840
let's just call it Launch6.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.670
Spot instances. Keep in mind,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.810
spot instances can be stopped by Amazon if they need to reclaim that compute at any time.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.300
So that's something you need to consider carefully if you'd like

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.045
to request spot instances in your launch configuration.

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:01.240
If you ever have any questions about what's going on and what they're asking of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.630
you when you're on creating a launch configuration or anything really,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.450
if you see this I next to it, just hover over it,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.710
then gives you a brief description of what this field is looking for.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.730
So we're not going to request spot instances this time,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.950
we're not going to select the special IAM role.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.400
Even though CloudWatch monitoring for general metrics are as free,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.790
I'm enabling detailed monitoring does incur a cost.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.395
So keep that in mind if you're going to enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring.

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:35.900
We`re going to move forward with our instances where it's going

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.115
to accept the default eight gigs to storage.

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:45.270
An existing security group is going to be fine or take the default security group.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.290
If you'd like to look at your details of what you selected, you can go down here,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.370
expand storage, see we got our [inaudible] to expand security group.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.650
That should show us our default security group.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.110
Go ahead and create a launch configuration.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.880
Now we've done that.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.090
Now we're onto our second step,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.570
creating the Auto Scaling group and let's just call it Group6 to go at Launch6.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:29.320
We're going to start with two instances and select a couple subnets here.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.120
So we're going to create our scaling group and use the scaling policies here.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.990
We're going to configure scale between two and six instances this is

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.895
Group6 after all and scale group size,

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.845
let's just call this Size6,

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:56.745
and the metric we're going to use a CPU utilization,

00:03:56.745 --> 00:04:01.770
let's just target 89 percent utilization,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.875
that's high but this is just an example.

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:08.225
Notifications, if you'd like to,

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:12.035
you can subscribe to notifications if you haven't done that,

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.260
but don't worry about it.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.990
Subscribing to notifications is just basically confirming your contact information,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.550
your email address with Amazon,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.530
so we're going to skip that for now.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.005
Any tags that you'd like to configure,

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:25.700
this is where you'd select those.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.415
So remember tag is a key and a value.

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:33.345
So we can say life cycle,

00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:42.970
let's spell life cycle and our value is going to be development,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.090
just for example, review our scaling group and if everything looks good,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.330
we'll go ahead and create our Auto Scaling group.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.875
Looks like we were successful.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:58.730
Sometimes I've seen this have an error the first time,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.065
and if you run it again,

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:02.735
it will normally be successful for you.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.730
Go ahead and close this.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:12.675
Now we've got an Auto Scaling group that's using Launch6 configuration.

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:17.465
We have a launch configuration, Launch6 right here.

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:20.960
If you want to delete it,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.200
this is where you take that action.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.785
If you're not wanting to keep this example and Auto Scaling group,

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.960
you can also delete that.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.805
If you`re going to delete your Auto Scaling group that is tied to a launch configuration,

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:38.065
you have to delete your launch configuration first.

00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:41.565
Everyone, thanks for joining and following along.

00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:44.640
See you at the end of the next exercise.
