00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Cloud computing makes it possible to launch your applications as

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.430
fully scalable from the start by implementing a service called auto scaling.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.770
Auto scaling is a term used to describe the automatic changes that add or remove

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.830
compute resources in order to maintain stable performance and control costs.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.920
The auto scaling service monitors your applications and adjust compute resources

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.770
based on predefined criteria to make sure that

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.905
the application has the capacity it needs to serve demand.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:36.735
When demand decreases, it scales the resources back

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:42.100
in to ensure compute resources are not idle and costs are controlled.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.805
Auto scaling in the Cloud is described in terms of vertical or scaling up and down,

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:52.865
and horizontal or scaling out and in.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:58.105
Vertical auto scaling is a process of adding more resources to the system,

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:00.760
like memory or CPU.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.410
In AWS terms, it would be moving to a larger instance.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.460
Horizontal scaling is the process of adding

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.555
more nodes or workers to increase compute resources.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:19.940
In AWS terms, it would mean adding more EC2 instances.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.655
You can configure scaling for all AWS resources,

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:26.860
from the Auto scaling interface.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.820
The services you can configure are EC2,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.325
EC2 Spot Fleets, ECS,

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:40.160
Dynamo DB, and AWS Aurora.
