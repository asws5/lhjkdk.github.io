00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Public Cloud expenditures are on the rise,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:05.940
and despite the rapid adoption of Cloud technology,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.840
public Cloud customers are still failing to harness the full power of Cloud computing.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.860
Accurate cost comparisons between AWS and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.920
traditional on-premises data centers are hard to pin down

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.740
accurately as there are very few head-to-head features to evaluate.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.160
AWS doesn't have many services that can be

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.010
directly compared to a counterpart in the data center.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.360
For example, the closest comparison we can make to an

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.905
on-premises server is an on-demand EC2 instance.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:34.280
But even in that case,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.580
we would have to compare identically configured servers running at

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.290
full capacity together any insight into how they compare.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.400
In the Cloud, there's a concept called

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.285
capacity that represents a server's resource potential.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:52.375
Physical servers are spec'd out and quoted at a purchase or lease price,

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.360
and once they're in, they're yours,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.820
with no returns and no refunds.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420
You make your payments and you do your best to utilize

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.555
your servers according to your plans and projections.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.520
Whereas in the Cloud,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.925
service can be provisioned almost as soon as you decide you need one.

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:11.075
It only takes minutes to configure and launch an instance,

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:14.540
and even less time to launch a previously saved machine image.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.870
So there's really no comparing it too.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.860
Another aspect of AWS is the democratization of resource procurement or

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.470
the potential of anyone in your Cloud technology group to

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.460
purchase AWS resources at anytime.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.415
The old way of purchasing IT resources involved committees,

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:35.194
budget allocations, projections of VP of finance,

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:37.555
and endless levels of approvals.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:41.360
In the Cloud, there's an account configured with an open credit card or

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.340
purchase order that can be assigned to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
a technical group or a traditional finance or accounting team,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.545
and with the proper roles and permissions,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:52.405
anyone on the Cloud technology team can procure Cloud resources.

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:56.630
While this has led to improved efficiency in the development process and greatly

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.040
accelerated the pace of innovation due to on-demand availability of resources,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.750
it's also translated into

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.640
a complex billing structure for

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.350
non-technical finance staff to interpret at the end of the month.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.960
This shift has opened a lane for many third-party software in

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.195
Cloud consulting firms to offer billing interpretation and optimization services.

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.280
You will definitely become familiar with some

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.775
of these vendors as you progress in your career.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.080
Understanding Cloud billing is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.740
a valuable skill that we'll have begun to master by the end of this lesson.
