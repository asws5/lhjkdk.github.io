00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.834
In the Cloud, customers pay for actions,

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:06.660
acquisitions, data transfer, and managed services.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.390
They pay for pretty much everything other than the initial data upload that's free.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.400
Keep in mind that you don't really own anything in the public Cloud.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.230
You are essentially paying to use the services and the provider

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.420
agrees to supply and support them similar to a lease agreement.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.905
You can view AWS as a platform of almost 200 managed services.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.385
Some of the costs of the technology management

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.040
are built into the fees you pay for these services.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.705
So if you're paying $1.50 an hour to run an EC2 instance,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.675
part of that charge is for the management of the instance.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.695
That is, AWS and their technology teams securing,

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:49.180
updating, and maintaining the server on your behalf.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.510
This is another reason it isn't realistic to compare Cloud to physical.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.570
One terabyte of data may cost more in the Cloud,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.900
but it may be worth it to pay more when you don't have to secure it,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.850
maintain it, back it up,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.430
or provide the 11 9s guarantee.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.615
The AWS 11 9s guarantee is a representation of AWS S3's durability.

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:15.605
Durability is used to measure the likelihood of data loss.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:19.790
So an AWS says that they guarantee 11 9s of durability,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.500
they are saying that 99.999999999

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.865
percent chance that your files will remain available in S3.

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:36.515
In other words, if you gave AWS one million files to store, statistically,

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:40.345
they would lose one file every 659,000 years,

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:43.775
or if you store 100 billion files in S3,

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.235
AWS might lose one.

00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:49.700
I say might because S3 durability increases when

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.120
you spread your objects across regions and availability zones.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.310
Establishing controls around provisioning

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.320
Cloud resources is the key to preventing a billing disaster.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.350
Imagine how unmanageable and disorganized an AWS environment would

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.000
be if all users could spin up instances, create databases,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.664
backup drives to S3,

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:14.425
and run applications on servers with more power than they need just because they can,

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.765
essentially a technology spending free for all.

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.725
How can you get in front of this situation?

00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:25.220
Establish a naming convention for servers and databases,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.815
use tags to associate resources with cost centers,

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:35.360
establish IT governance rules and make sure everyone follows them,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.650
setup user roles and control so only

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.905
certain roles are allowed to provision infrastructure,

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.140
and use billing alarms to notify

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.759
the admin tier when the bill has reached or exceeded a certain threshold.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.570
Establishing and enforcing rules and guidelines for procuring

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.310
Cloud resources when you first establish your account prevents overspend,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.455
rogue infrastructure, and rework.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.460
Cost allocation tags help you keep track of which group,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.340
lifecycle, person, or application a cost belongs to.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.695
It is much easier to keep track of AWS costs

00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:16.375
when you can balance out your monthly bill by cost allocation tag.

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:19.924
You'll know which costs are production, which are test,

00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:23.524
which costs belong to your pro bono city government project,

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:26.485
and which cost belong in the experimental bucket.

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:29.420
It's a practical organizational task and should be

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.480
standard protocol for every new Cloud implementation.
