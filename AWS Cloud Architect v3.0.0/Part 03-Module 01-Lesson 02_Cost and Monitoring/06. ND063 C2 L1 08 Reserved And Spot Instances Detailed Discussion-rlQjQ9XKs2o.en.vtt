00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Two of the easiest ways to save money on EC2 instances is

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.190
by reserving compute capacity in advance and by bidding on Spot Instances.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.590
Spot Instances are AWS excess compute capacity

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.050
made available for sale to the public at a steep discount.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.460
It can be reclaimed at anytime,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.610
so it should be used for

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.000
your non-essential computing functions that don't require 100 percent availability,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.839
like stateless, non-production workloads, batch jobs,

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.100
Sandbox Environments, or really any

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.750
application where some short notice downtime is acceptable.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.950
Reserved instances provide up to 75 percent discount when compared to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.470
on-demand pricing when you commit to purchasing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.375
instances in a particular availability zone upfront.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:49.520
Instances can be reserved for a period of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.720
one or three years and come in two classes: Convertible and Standard.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.890
Convertible Reserved Instances cost a bit more for the flexibility of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.445
being able to exchange them for convertible instances of equal or lesser value later.

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:10.790
Standard Reserved Instances cannot be exchanged.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.535
Once you buy those, they're yours.

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:14.845
You can also purchase

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:19.315
Convertible Reserved Instances and the Convertible Reserved Instance Marketplace.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:23.950
I'll provide a link for more information in that in the further research link below.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.400
Spot Instances are AWS unused EC2 capacity.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.170
That AWS sells at up to 90 percent discount when compared to on-demand pricing.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.430
Spot Instances are up for sale for an hourly price on the Spot market,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.430
and the market price fluctuates based on availability and demand.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.420
You set your Spot price and your spot instance will run whenever capacity is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.095
available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.840
Spot Instances are good for fault tolerance,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.630
stateless, and flexible applications.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.945
Some good examples are containerized workloads,

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:07.880
test and dev workloads,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.885
web servers, and batch processes.

00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:14.970
Spot Instances have one major drawback,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.740
AWS can reclaim the capacity allocated to your Spot Instance with two minutes of notice.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.360
At the two-minute mark,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.720
your Instance will be terminated.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.420
If you can be flexible about when your applications run,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.395
and if they can be interrupted,

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:35.345
Spot Instances are a great cost-effective choice.

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:41.230
Lastly, AWS offers Dedicated Instances and Dedicated Hosts.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.630
Some companies have a requirement that their application is not run on shared servers.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.430
So AWS offers the option of Dedicated Hosts,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.450
Instances launched on physical servers that are dedicated for your use.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.610
Dedicated Instances are run in a VPC on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer.
