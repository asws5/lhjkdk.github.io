00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
AWS currently offers three calculators for use

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.885
by Cloud technologists to configure cost estimates.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:08.819
The simple monthly calculator,

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.550
which allows you to explore AWS services,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.800
model solutions, and create estimates for the cost of your use cases on AWS.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.074
The TCO calculator or total cost of ownership calculator,

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:25.200
which is used to compare the cost of running your applications in an on-premises or

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.499
co-location environment to AWS and the AWS pricing calculator,

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.050
which is new calculator currently in beta that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.040
will eventually replace a simple monthly calculator.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.880
Use the AWS free tier wisely.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.800
Although we are using the generous AWS free tier to complete this nano degree,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.700
it is still possible to incur service charges and fees.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.500
Only some of the AWS services are available for free.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.255
Make sure you are knowledgeable about what is included in your 12 month trial.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:03.035
You can learn more in the free tier FAQs.

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:07.880
It is also important to terminate or delete services when you no longer need them.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.030
Because we're mostly working in the AWS console,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.550
it is very easy to close your browser tab out of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.030
habit and forget to stop you're running Cloud services.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.345
Costs can add up quickly in the Cloud.

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:24.560
I'll let you know when we're using items that may be out of the free tier

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.685
and I'll also remind you to wind down the services when we're done with an exercise.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.650
But it's your responsibility to use AWS services wisely.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.610
Secure your AWS account with two-factor authentication.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.070
Remember when you registered for your AWS account,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.100
you provided a form of payment.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.200
It is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.455
secure your account and prevent unauthorized use.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:51.020
In fact, if you haven't already configured

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.855
your AWS account for two-factor authentication,

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.430
please take the time to do it now.
