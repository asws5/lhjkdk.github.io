00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
CloudTrail is Amazon's account logging service that provides auditing,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.385
governance, and compliance visibility into every API call made in the AWS account.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.045
The API call in details are into a log file

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:19.330
and maintained for 90 days without any configuration on the user's part.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.475
CloudTrail captures who or what made the call.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.515
The who or what could be a user,

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:28.185
application or AWS service.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.430
What time it happened,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.739
the user or process that took the action,

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.540
and the service or resource that was affected by the action.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.000
CloudTrail Logs keep a running account of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.695
API calls and saves them in a secure and immutable format in a JSON file called an event.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.980
The law can be filtered and searched by metadata like date and time,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.334
user or AWS service,

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.740
but it can't be modified.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.970
CloudTrail Logs can be configured to be sent and consumed by CloudWatch.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.000
Publishing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch provides

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.330
the ability to create alarms based on CloudTrail Log data,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.875
and visualize CloudTrail log data through the CloudWatch dashboards.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.240
CloudTrail Logs can be configured to publish

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.530
Cloud Shell data to CloudWatch as soon as they're created.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.060
Once a CloudTrail has been created,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.965
the option for sending the log data to CloudWatch becomes available.

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:31.195
In order to configure CloudTrail to share data with CloudWatch,

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.130
you need to create an IAM role for CloudTrail with

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.465
a policy that allows it to access CloudWatch.

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:41.660
The roles required to write the stream of log data are create

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.615
log stream and put log events in a CloudWatch Log.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:49.730
We're going to take a look at creating a CloudTrail,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.450
which as we know is a record of all the API calls that take place in this AWS account.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.545
So by default, CloudTrail keeps a record of

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.900
all of the events for the last 90 days without you

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.555
having to create a specific CloudTrail.

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:07.160
If you'd like to see that,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.345
you can go to event history and explore that data.

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:20.660
If you like click on the arrow and take a look at what data CloudTrail collects.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.345
As you scroll down, you'll see a button called View event,

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:28.100
and that's going to open a window that shows you the CloudTrail data in JSON format.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.570
So let's go to trails and create a trail.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.220
Let's call our trail CloudLab1.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.130
We're going to only collect data in this region and create it and store it here.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.845
We're not going to log KMS events,

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:52.045
but we are going to log all the Read/Wright events,

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:56.535
and we're going to log all the API activity for S3 buckets.

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:59.085
We're going to create a new S3 bucket,

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:04.150
I would like to call my S3 bucket lesliecloudlab23456.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.690
Lets tag it with the environment,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.170
production,and create a CloudTrail There you have it.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.330
A brand new CloudTrail is created in the US East one region,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.030
Northern Virginia. Thanks for joining.
