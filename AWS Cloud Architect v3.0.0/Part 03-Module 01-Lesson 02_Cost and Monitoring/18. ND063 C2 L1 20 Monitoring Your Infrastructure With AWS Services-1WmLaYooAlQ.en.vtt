00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
Although most of your work is technical,

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:06.795
you must set aside time to partner with IT Finance to baseline,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.740
project, monitor, and manage your costs.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900
Consistently monitoring your AWS account for costs is imperative.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.185
Your cost baselines need to be defined and adhered to by every member of the Cloud team.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.990
Remember, that runaway costs can be

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.130
an unexpected side effect of not defining baselines and expectations,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.035
and often lead to disappointment,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:35.500
disillusionment, and the abandonment of Cloud technology projects.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.660
Establishing a tagging strategy prior to initiating

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.625
your Cloud projects is so important when establishing a cost monitoring protocol,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:49.640
because it simplifies the process of associating AWS costs with their business use.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.160
This allows your finance team to ensure

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.385
budgetary resources are being allocated according to their stated purpose.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:00.865
Using Cost Explorer and Trusted Adviser,

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.170
which is free for some support accounts,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.370
to uncover opportunities to reduce and refine your service costs,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.100
is also an important task that should be assigned to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.740
a Cloud resource on your team and executed regularly,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.910
with the results being shared and tracked over time,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.960
and documented for response and resolution.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.970
Despite our best efforts,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.340
and the vigilance of our internal security teams,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.704
and AWS security monitoring,

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:29.785
Cloud breaches have been known to occur.

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:35.720
In most cases, human error leaves the door open for malice use of an AWS account.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.600
If this rare event was ever to occur,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.385
the damage can often be mitigated by a fast response to a billing alert,

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.780
letting you know that an out of bounds cost has occurred.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.040
AWS wants you to succeed on their platform.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030
So they offer assistance in the following ways.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.120
AWS Cost Explorer, which is a tool that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.925
enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage,

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:00.760
and in a graph or report,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.840
Cost Explorer is very useful in forecasting costs and predicting word services,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.030
like Reserved Instances, may offer cost savings.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.080
AWS CodeGuru, which is a fully managed service that helps you proactively

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.515
improve code quality and application performance with intelligent recommendations.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.270
It reviews your code and finds code issues

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.240
during code reviews before they reach production,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.150
including needlessly costly lines of code,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.400
race conditions, memory leaks, and runaway logging.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.665
AWS Solutions architects are professional AWS certified engineers,

00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:41.210
who are deployed by AWS to assist

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.905
customers in solving the most challenging engineering problems.

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:49.400
Costs for this assistants vary based on your support agreement,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.675
and of course, the relative value of your account.

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:56.810
AWS also offers a count credits for certain customers,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.890
like startups, nonprofits, and academic institutions.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.740
It also never hurts to ask AWS for credits,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.140
no matter who you are.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.010
Competition among Cloud providers is heating up,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.300
and AWS has an interest in your success as a customer,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.000
and may provide credits that allow you to try a new service,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.710
or onboard a new application.
