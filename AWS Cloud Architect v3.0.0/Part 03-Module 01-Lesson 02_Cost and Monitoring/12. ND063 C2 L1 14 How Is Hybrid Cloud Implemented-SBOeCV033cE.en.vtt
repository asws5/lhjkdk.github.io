00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.925
Enterprise hybrid cloud infrastructure is often a mix of cloud providers,

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:09.465
on-premises data centers, and edge locations.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:11.789
Hybrid cloud is where cost,

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.735
control, regulations, and security intersect.

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.180
Hybrid Cloud with AWS provides

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.305
organizations the flexibility to support a range of use cases.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.530
They can maintain regulatory compliance and consolidate

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.405
their technology stack under one umbrella using a common set of services and tools.

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:35.360
Hybrid cloud accelerates innovation by providing customers with

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.090
rapid and low cost infrastructure provisioning

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.120
for prototyping and testing innovative solutions,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.425
and removing the limitations of traditional IT planning and budgeting.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:50.240
It also provides companies with disaster recovery when multiple cloud providers are

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.175
included in the disaster recovery and business continuity technology plan.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:01.415
Using a cloud is a hot backup solution for disaster recovery requires a lot of planning.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:03.155
It can be a good strategy,

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:05.300
but it isn't without costs.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.020
What you can do is you can run your data transfer intensive applications in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.645
the data center and on-premises because those costs are fixed,

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:19.270
and you can run your variable in Internet-based applications in the cloud.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.070
AWS provides considerable support for

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.355
organizations that want to implement hybrid infrastructure.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:30.095
A typical enterprise will have a mix of cloud and on-premises data centers.

00:01:30.095 --> 00:01:34.630
Hybrid cloud architectures allow customers to have the best of both worlds.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.330
The control required for many rules and regulations related to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.965
data governance that makes on-premises architecture so appealing and the speed,

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:47.785
scalability, and flexibility of running workloads and storing data in the cloud.

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:52.025
In response to customers need to have physical control over their data,

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:56.035
AWS has a hybrid service called AWS Outposts.

00:01:56.035 --> 00:02:00.049
AWS Outpost is a physical computer storage appliance

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.245
that resides on premises in the customer data center.

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:07.175
It is truly AWS Cloud on-prem.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:10.355
It provides secure transfer and retrieval,

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:15.500
encrypts all data at rest and before moving to the AWS public cloud.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.420
Key points to remember about hybrid architecture are that some regulations

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.835
require that certain data be in a data center

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.795
under your control and not in a public cloud.

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:28.700
So you have to maintain a physical presence even though

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.215
you're moving some applications and workloads to the public cloud.

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:34.810
Data transfer in is free,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.770
but that's about it.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.170
Some types of data will be required to be

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.965
encrypted before being uploaded to the public cloud.

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:45.800
So you need to be aware of your company's rules and governance guidance around

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.640
public cloud services before procuring cloud resources.
