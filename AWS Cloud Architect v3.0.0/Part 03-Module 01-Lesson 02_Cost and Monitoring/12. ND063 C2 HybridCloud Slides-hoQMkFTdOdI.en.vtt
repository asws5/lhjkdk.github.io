00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Hybrid Cloud is often

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.505
the infrastructure model that kick starts the process of moving to the Cloud.

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:10.320
Corporations often use Cloud data storage as

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.780
a first step toward moving to the Cloud because it's so easy and inexpensive.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.659
Basic Cloud storage doesn't require any special access or networking.

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.170
S3 buckets are accessible over the Internet.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.425
It's easy to procure storage quickly and you only pay for what you need.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:36.930
Two of the most obvious and frequently cited benefits of hybrid Cloud,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.050
are that you have a backup of your data to assist with

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.100
disaster recovery efforts and data portability.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.360
Having all of your data in the Cloud makes it easier for you to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.085
move it between Cloud providers if it becomes necessary.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:53.780
Connecting the on-premises data center to

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.830
the Cloud provider requires networking expertise and support

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.860
from the network team and the Cloud technology team in order to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.660
implement the fastest connection and most secure solution.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.990
The connectivity to the data center is secured via a customer managed

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.990
gateway and a VPN or AWS direct connect.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.680
AWS direct connect is a service that facilitates the establishment of

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.115
a secure dedicated network connection between the on-premises network and the Cloud.

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.765
Data is encrypted end to end,

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:30.395
meaning it's encrypted at rest on-premises,

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:35.530
encrypted in transfer, and encrypted at rest in the Cloud.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.505
Securing the connection between the data center

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:40.910
and the Cloud and monitoring the connection is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.715
important because the connection is a vulnerability

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:47.245
that is frequently targeted by outsiders for exploitation.

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:53.060
AWS VPN enables hybrid connectivity by providing the ability to connect

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.510
your on-premises environment to your AWS VPC

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.790
over an encrypted Internet connection to maintain data integrity.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.745
An AWS direct connect is a private network connection

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:08.540
between the on-premises environment and AWS that allows you to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.960
establish a faster and more secure connection by using

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.120
private IP space via an AWS direct connect location.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.820
Using direct connect also has the benefit of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.880
potential data transfer cost reduction because

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.590
data transfer that uses

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.210
a direct connection is charged at the lower direct connection rate.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.645
The AWS VPC provides and manages

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:36.110
all the connections into the Cloud environment and resources,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
including public Internet connections, VPNs,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.035
direct connections, peering connections, and subnets.

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:49.580
Defining your subnets and IP addressing schemes is the beginning of building out

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.070
your Cloud network infrastructure and controlling

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.970
access into and out of your Cloud environment.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.159
In order to communicate with your on-premises environment,

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.650
you need to have network routing configured between the data center and the VPC.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.555
Subnets can be public or private,

00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:10.165
and how they're defined is based on how they're configured to communicate in the VPC.

00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:12.440
In the AWS VPC,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.339
the public subnet is for public facing servers like web servers,

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.230
bastion hosts, proxies, and VPNs.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.830
Public subnets have an Internet gateway for routes out to the Internet from the VPC.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.895
Private subnets are for back-end servers like databases and internal load balancers.

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:36.020
There are routes between the subnets for communication between the tiers,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.445
but there are no routes from the private subnet to the Internet.

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:43.460
If the servers in the private subnet need to access the Internet,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.550
for example, to download an update or a license key,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.230
the servers in the private subnet need to use a net gateway in the public subnet,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.530
that is a one-way connection out to the Internet that

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.950
doesn't allow the Internet to connect back into the servers in the private subnet.
