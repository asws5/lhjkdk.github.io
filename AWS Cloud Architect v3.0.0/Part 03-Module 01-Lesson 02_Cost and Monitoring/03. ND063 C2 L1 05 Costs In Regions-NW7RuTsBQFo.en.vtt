00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
Looking at how region affects costs is the easiest way to cut costs off the bat.

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:15.150
Currently, AWS has 22 regions and 69 availability zones serving 245 countries.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.550
In addition, there are 210 published points of presence consisting of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.400
a 199 edge locations and 11 regional edge caches.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.665
By the time you're watching this video,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:29.850
there will be more,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.975
as AWS is rapidly expanding his footprint across the globe.

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:36.015
Points of presence are used by

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:41.505
AWS CloudFront to deliver content to end users with lower latency.

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:48.100
An AWS region is a physical location where Amazon has clustered data centers.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.810
Each cluster of data centers is referred to as an Availability Zone or AZ.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.740
AZs are designed to be redundant locations for each other and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.245
provide customers with automatic fault-tolerance and high availability.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:09.305
AWS local zones are extensions of an AWS region that place compute storage,

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:13.975
database, and other AWS services closer to the end users.

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:17.255
Local zones are designed to run ultra-fast,

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.940
highly demanding applications to end users,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.715
such as media and content creation,

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.510
real time gaming, and machine learning.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.345
Most AWS costs depend on the region you choose for deployment.

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:34.430
There are several factors at play when it comes to cost

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.925
variance in regions such as local regulations,

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.785
the cost of doing business,

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.510
the price of utilities,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.800
supply and demand, competition, and many more.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.020
The least costly region,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.850
and the region with the most complete suite of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.370
AWS services is US-East-1, or Northern Virginia.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.100
This is also the region where AWS deploys new services first.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.094
This region is preferred by many AWS architects for speed and stability.

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:07.580
On the flip side,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.970
when this region experiences technical issues or an outage,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.545
it affects millions of users and is quite disruptive.

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:16.850
While this is the preferred region,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.730
it may not be practical to exclusively

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.225
host your application here if your users are global.

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:26.120
There are steps you can take to reduce your costs while

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.420
hosting your applications in more costly regions.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.070
When data transfer costs from EC2 to the public Internet or significant,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.685
consider using AWS CloudFront.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:41.330
Images, videos, or static web content can be cached at

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.395
AWS edge locations worldwide using the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network.

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:51.020
A content delivery network is a network of servers that delivers

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.695
web and media content to users based on where they're located.

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:58.675
Providing the content faster and with higher availability.

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:04.065
Architecture solution to avoid inter-regional data transfer costs whenever possible.

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:08.165
For example, accessing the data from Amazon S3

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:12.560
via Amazon EC2 within the same region is free of charge.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.280
Whereas accessing Amazon S3 data from a different region incurs a data transfer cost.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.150
If you have resources in different regions or multiple AWS accounts then using

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.939
VPC peering or VPC sharing can help you further optimize and reduce your costs.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.585
You can use a service called AWS transit gateway,

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.520
which acts as a hub that controls how

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.955
internal traffic is routed among the connected networks,

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:41.759
simplifying management and reducing costs
