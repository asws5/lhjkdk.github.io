00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
AWS provides many storage options for backup, archiving,

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.275
and disaster recovery in the form of block,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.435
file, and object storage.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.970
These low-cost storage options provide

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.855
high availability and durability for different use cases.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:20.400
It is important not only to understand the appropriate use cases for storage,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.470
but also the underlying cost structure.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.945
Storage costs will also differ depending on

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:33.785
AWS region and how you choose to structure and manage your storage using AWS services.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:39.020
It's important to provision the required amount of block storage and scale up as needed.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.885
As block storage must be defined in advance

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:44.959
as opposed to object storage and file storage,

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:47.720
which grows as objects and files are added.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.525
Amazon also provides various tools for monitoring storage usage and lifecycle management.

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:59.185
For example, you can use the AWS billing console, bills,

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:02.600
and cost explorer, to gain insight into how you're

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.205
using storage resources and managing your storage budget.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:08.659
When calculating storage costs,

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.820
you must also consider all aspects of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.350
storage billing in order to get an accurate view of your storage expenses.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.570
The storage attributes to consider

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.175
are: the storage capacity that you've provisioned and used,

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:28.715
data transfer costs, replication across availability zones and regions,

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:31.760
and storage access patterns.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.435
Here is the list of storage options available in Amazon Web Services.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:43.505
Block Storage is procured in advance and can be resized as needed.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.460
You have the option of using magnetic drives,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.845
which are best for throughput intensive workloads

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:51.830
like big data analysis and log processing,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.510
and solid state drives,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.050
which are best for I/O intensive applications and database services and boot volumes.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.960
Magnetic drives also come in a cold storage option,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.075
which is best for data that isn't accessed much during an average day.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:12.020
Elastic file system, or EFS is a Cloud file system that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.060
emulates the file shares we're used to working with

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.575
today on Windows and Unix-based systems.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:22.430
EFS can be differentiated by the feature that allows it to either stand alone as

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.310
a share or be connected to multiple EC2 instances at the same time.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.565
You do not need to provision EFS storage if scales is needed,

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:34.310
keeping costs to what you're using at the time.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.115
S3 storage is object storage,

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:42.830
a scalable storage service in the Cloud with four pricing components: storage,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.840
data transfer in and out,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.860
requests, and S3 transfer acceleration in and out.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.210
S3 provides the 11 lines of durability guarantee.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.800
There are several S3 service options available in AWS.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.570
S3 standard, which is the out of the box de facto standard S3

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.540
configuration option that most people think about when discussing S3 object storage.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.410
S3 standard IA or standard infrequently accessed,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.140
is a less costly standard storage option for

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.790
objects that you may need, but probably won't.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.540
S3 one zone IA provides a storage option with less redundancy than S3 IA,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.445
as the S3 objects are only replicated within one availability zone.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:38.120
S3 Glacier is Amazon's archive offering for files that are accessed so infrequently.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.760
But you agree that in exchange for a very,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.925
very inexpensive storage, that can take a few hours to return the objects to you.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:50.195
Of course, if you need archived objects in less than a few hours,

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.080
you can pay for accelerated retrieval.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.630
An AWS Snowball is a physical device that

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.565
Amazon ships to customers to upload petabytes of object data into S3,

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.010
saving time and network bandwidth.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.910
The device is actually shipped back to Amazon for upload into AWS S3.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.045
Storage needs to be planned with an archiving, retention,

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.370
and deletion strategy from the start,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.794
or storage and data transfer costs will be considerably higher than necessary.

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:23.450
We're going to look at how a storage strategy eliminates

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.725
the burden of infinite storage costs and data transfer costs.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:33.530
Storage costs and requirements need to be well understood by the architect.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.115
Use magnetic drives over SSD drives whenever possible.

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:44.640
Consider data transfer costs before adopting Glacier for archive.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.170
Use the S3 endpoint in the VPC to

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.525
eliminate costs associated with public Internet traffic to S3.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:58.115
Make use of incremental backups and establish a robust lifecycle policy.

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:01.040
Imagine the job of a new architect who joins

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.200
a company and has to manage terabytes of unstructured S3 data.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.850
It would be impossible to know what's in there,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.170
what's a key then,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.819
what should be deleted?

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.950
Most people would just keep everything and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.350
continue to pay for storage of objects they don't need to

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.795
keep because they didn't define a lifecycle policy or use tagging from the beginning.

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:24.830
Make sure you involve your organization's governance team to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.195
establish a file retention policy for Cloud storage and follow it.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:32.100
Get everyone involved.
