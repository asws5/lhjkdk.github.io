00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
So I've logged in to the AWS Management Console

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:09.420
to give you a demonstration of tagging an S3 bucket.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.700
So I'm going to go to S3 and create a bucket.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.330
I'm going to add four tags.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.930
Tagging makes it easier to manage and search for your resources in AWS.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.110
So let me create my bucket,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.710
making sure it's in US East 1,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.325
and just go ahead and hit Next.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:47.585
I'm going to use tags which organize in a key value pair system.

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:48.965
So my first key,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.790
I'm going to use is going to be team.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.695
My team is going to be logistics.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:08.040
I'm going to add another tag for project and we're going to call our project mercury.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.485
Let's add one more tag.

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:15.470
Let's add lifecycle, and we'll say that

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.800
all the files that go into this bucket are development.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.745
So next, next, create our bucket.

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:28.729
We see we have three tags,

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.190
that'll help us organize the data that goes into this bucket and search for it,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.370
find it later, and manage it in the future.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.590
Thanks for following along and go ahead and create some tags on your own buckets.
