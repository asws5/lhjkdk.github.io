00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.745
So here's my solution to exercise to S3 lifecycle policy.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:10.950
Going to login to the AWS management console and go to S3.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.975
You can also find S3 by typing S3 here in the search bar,

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:18.885
or find the S3 up here under services.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.575
So we're going to go to S3, and I'm going to create

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:28.800
an S3 bucket called Leslie Cloudlab bucket,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.100
and I'm going to accept all of the default settings,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.829
making sure I'm in the right region,

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.110
US East 1, Northern Virginia.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.849
I'm just going to accept all the defaults next,

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:48.530
next, next, and then create my bucket.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.815
So I'll go ahead and open my bucket here,

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:57.300
and I'm going to upload a couple of files of a decent size.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.805
Let's take the AWS Well Architected Framework,

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:08.520
and the Cost Optimization Pillar,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.870
and go ahead and upload those files.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.330
Now that my files are uploaded,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.395
we're going to create our lifecycle policy.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.000
We're going to start by selecting

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.145
the management tab and click here on "Add lifecycle rule".

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:42.715
I'm going to name my rule Leslie Cloudlab Rule,

00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:46.250
and it's going to apply to all objects in my bucket.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.070
Select the current version of my files because there really are no previous versions.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.440
We're going to start by adding our first transition, click "Add Transition".

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.390
What we're going to do is we're going to transition our files to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.870
standard and frequent access after 31 days.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.190
Our second transition is going to be,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.930
to move our files to Glacier after 61 days.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.770
We're going to have to accept that we acknowledged that this lifecycle rule will

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.845
increase if the objects are too small for the transition.

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.860
So accept that and click "Next".

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.680
We're going to configure an exploration or

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.530
deletion of our files on the current version again,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.630
and we're going to set those files to be deleted after a 180 days and click on "Next".

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.950
Once again, acknowledge the lifecycle rule.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.370
Basically, AWS wants you to acknowledge

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.825
that you know you're going to be deleting files after a 180 days,

00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.530
and we're going to save our rule.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.620
As we can see now, we have a lifecycle rule that's going to move

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.630
our files to IA after 31 days and after 61 days,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.860
it's going to move them to Glacier.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.740
In other words, end of the exercise.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.520
Let's make sure we delete our lifecycle rule, confirm it.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.550
If you like, you can actually go back to our bucket and you can delete that as well.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.130
Thanks for completing an exercise and don't forget to log out.
