00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Managing cloud spend is quoted as,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.810
"One of the major challenges facing experienced IT organizations today."

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.540
In some cases, IT organizations that have adopted Cloud technology have abandoned

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.270
their efforts due to both overwhelming costs and

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.460
the work it takes to understand and manage costs in the Cloud.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.660
There are costs associated with the Cloud that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.820
simply don't exist in the data center model,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.465
such as data transfer fees and per second billing.

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:29.810
This lesson will help you understand the challenges of costs in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.470
the Cloud and give you some tools to help you manage those costs.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.605
We will start with an overview of Cloud costs.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:41.420
Then we'll take a deeper look at AWS service pricing for instances, storage,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.789
and databases, and identify best practices for managing costs in each type of service.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.970
We'll end the lesson by looking at cost optimization and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.870
best practices for monitoring costs. Let's get started.
