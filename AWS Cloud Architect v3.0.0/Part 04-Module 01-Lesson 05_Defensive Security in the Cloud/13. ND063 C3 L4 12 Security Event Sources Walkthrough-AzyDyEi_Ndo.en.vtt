00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
In this walkthrough, I'm going to examine CloudTrail logs and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.625
attempt to set up monitoring in CloudWatch for a specific event type.

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.625
Let's take a look at the CloudTrail settings.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:18.495
For this walkthrough, I have enabled CloudTrail to send logs to CloudWatch logs.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:21.120
Let's see how that looks.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.285
So in my CloudTrail settings,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:31.490
I've enabled CloudTrail events to be logged in CloudWatch logs.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.970
So I'm going to look for this log group in CloudWatch logs.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.310
So let's go to CloudWatch.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.460
On my CloudWatch logs,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.630
I have a log group where all my CloudTrail events are sent.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.760
I've also set up a metric filter which is designed

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.845
to identify any events related to S3 bucket encryption.

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.455
So let's take a look at that filter.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:05.240
So this filter will flag any events which are

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.250
named PutBucket Encryption or DeleteBucketEncryption.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.865
So this can provide monitoring on changes or removal

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:23.390
to the S3 bucket encryption settings on any of the S3 buckets in my account.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:34.335
So I'm going to go into this metric and as you can see in the last three hours,

00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:36.530
I'm going to change the graph.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.475
So it shows me the total number of calls,

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:44.510
I'm going to choose sum and this is going

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.565
to show me that total number of calls in any given period.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:52.950
So as you can see earlier today,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.210
this metric was triggered a couple times.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:07.785
So we've seen how to use CloudWatch logs to search for events coming out of CloudTrail

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:12.970
and we can take these metrics and create alarms when something

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.560
happens and get notified or we can create custom dashboards that will show these metrics.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.725
So it's a very powerful way to be notified of when certain security events occur.

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:29.680
So in this walkthrough,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.300
we've gotten a chance to examine how CloudTrail logs can

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.830
be monitored using CloudWatch metrics.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.880
Next, we'll take a look at how we

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.380
can identify suspicious activity using the GuardDuty service.
