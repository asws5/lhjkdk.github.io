00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
So in addition to CloudWatch,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.524
we can also use GuardDuty to analyze

00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:13.305
our event sources and notify of any suspicious behavior activity.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.290
So I'm going to go through GuardDuty and look at some of

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.635
the finding types that it generates.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:21.360
So from my console,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.150
I'm going to go into GuardDuty just to get a feel for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.945
the types of events that GuardDuty can identify.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.830
Now, I've gone ahead and generated some sample events,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.245
so these are all dummy events.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:36.690
Let's take a look at some of them.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.910
So the first one I'm going to look at is a denial-of-service attack.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.345
So the GuardDuty has identified that there

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:57.125
may be a denial-of-service attack originating from one of my EC2 instances.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:02.300
So that indicates that the EC2 instance may have been compromised.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.660
There is either a malicious piece of code or an individual who's logged into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.645
that instance and has initiated a denial-of-service attack on some external entity,

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.415
so we need to investigate that further.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:22.610
Let's take a look at another type of attack.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.145
Here's something similar.

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:29.000
So this is a cryptocurrency,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.220
Bitcoin mining tool that may be on one of my EC2 instances,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.840
so GuardDuty has identified that as an anomalous activity and it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.750
communicating with some outbound entity which is a known Bitcoin related IP address.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.715
So that's how GuardDuty as identified it.

00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:52.190
Again, this indicates that that instance may have been compromised.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.725
So it's definitely a high severity incident that needs to be researched right away.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:06.850
So one of the other example findings could be something like an SSH brute force attack,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.765
which means that some external IP address

00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:14.710
is trying to perform a brute force attack against an instance,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.580
trying to crack the password and login using SSH.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.735
So it's something that is good to have

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:27.985
visibility into and be aware of when somebody is trying to do something like that.

00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:34.630
So it's a best practice to put these type of tools in place because they can really

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.000
assist you in monitoring all of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.640
these different data streams and event streams for security monitoring.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.930
So you should have a better feel now for how to do

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.860
security event auditing and monitoring within AWS.
