00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
In this exercise, you went through the process of scanning

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.650
Terraform code and identifying a misconfiguration with the regular tool.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.620
Since the steps in this exercise were very

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.815
similar to the walk through which I had previously demonstrated,

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.910
you may refer to that for a step-by-step solution to this exercise.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.060
For this exercise, when you ran the regular tool,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.770
initially your output should have contained JSON statements like the above.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.505
You should have seen the summary portion which indicated that rules had failed.

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:36.905
You would have also identified the failed rule by the indication of a valid key of false.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:40.925
You should have remediated the vulnerability in your Terraform code

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:45.445
by changing the policy so that no longer allowed admin access.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:49.925
You may have updated the action portion of the policy from an allow

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:54.430
all wildcard to a specific action or set of actions.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.315
Once the fix was made,

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:58.520
you ran the regular tool again.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.430
You should have seen the summary portion which indicated that all rules have now passed.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.460
The applicable rule that previously failed would now

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.830
show as a valid Terraform template according to the IAM admin policy rule.
