00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Before we delve into tools and techniques,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:06.690
let's first get a better feel for common threat vectors that affect Cloud environments.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.435
This is not intended to be a comprehensive list.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.580
Rather, it is a high level look at

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.100
the most obvious and easy paths that

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.970
an attacker can take to exploit and gain access to Cloud resources.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.625
Let's first look at several external threats,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.280
meaning actors who are on the Internet and do not have

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.865
access to the private network space of our Cloud environment.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:31.725
The first external threat is to public-facing web applications.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:35.820
Attackers will attempt to exploit application related vulnerabilities,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.555
such as those found in the OWASP top 10.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:43.700
Cloud architects and engineers designing Cloud environments need to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.170
ensure that any external web applications are defended appropriately.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.520
Another external threat is to public-facing Cloud infrastructure.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.680
Aside from web applications,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.460
any others server infrastructure such as database servers,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.550
bastion hosts, and other infrastructure are prime targets for attackers.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.300
Any resources such as these need to have additional hardening in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.665
isolation from other internal resources that hosts sensitive data.

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:16.730
At a high level, the use of these types of resources and exposing

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.040
them to the Internet should be avoided, limited and restricted.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.975
Another external threat is the AWS API and console or the management plane.

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:31.100
Due to the inherent nature of the public cloud being public,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.740
access to the AWS API and services is public-facing.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.090
If this axis is compromised,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.215
an attacker could gain control of your environment from anywhere.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.825
What about internal threats?

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:48.110
If an attacker or a piece of malicious software is

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.169
deployed or has gained access to the private networks,

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:54.920
that are connected to either Cloud or on-premise IP space,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.065
we again need to ensure that Cloud hosts are hardened and restrict access.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:04.760
Internal attackers may also have gained access to instances in hosts running in

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.460
the Cloud and we'll attempt to install and run malware or access data on Cloud instances.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.435
Going back to the AWS API,

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.660
it can also become a target if attackers gain access to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.455
internal code repositories or instances that mistakenly hold API keys, and other secrets.

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:30.420
This again, would lead to a compromise of AWS services tied to the API.
