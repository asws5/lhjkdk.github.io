00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
I would like to thank you for giving me the chance

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.010
to share my knowledge and experience with you.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.890
It's an absolutely exciting time to be using

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.740
the Cloud to run your applications and infrastructure.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.485
With all the news about Cloud data breaches,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:18.480
it's a little scary to be thinking about hosting your applications and data in the Cloud.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
I'm really hopeful that the ideas that I shared will help you architect and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.885
deploy secure and protected applications in the Cloud with confidence.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.420
Without a doubt, the skills that you have gained from

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.670
the Cloud architect nanodegree program

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.240
will take you to the next level in your Cloud journey.
