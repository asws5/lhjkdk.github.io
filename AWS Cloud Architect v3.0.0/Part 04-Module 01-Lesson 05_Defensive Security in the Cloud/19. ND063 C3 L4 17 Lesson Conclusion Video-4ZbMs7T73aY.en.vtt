00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
In this lesson, we have looked at various methods and capabilities in the Cloud to defend

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.825
your Cloud infrastructure and applications

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:10.275
against misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and attacks.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:14.280
You should now have a better feel for best practices and recommendations

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.875
for identifying vulnerabilities prior to deployment in your infrastructure code.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:23.840
You should also be more aware of the different types of scanning that can be done to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.360
identify misconfigurations that could be to

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.705
vulnerabilities and breaches in a live environment.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:35.660
We also introduced operational security event sources in an AWS environment,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.295
and how those sources can be used to detect and audit activity of interest.

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:44.510
Finally, we examined how web application firewalls can be

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.310
used to defend Cloud environments and applications from exploitation.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.255
I hope that these concepts can be a value when designing,

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.940
deploying, and securing your Cloud workloads.
