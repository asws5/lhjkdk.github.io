00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
One of the most widely accepted benefits of leveraging public cloud services for running

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.980
applications is the speed and agility with

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.055
which we can deploy new infrastructure environments.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:15.450
Agility and speed of change bring challenges to security and stability.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.670
For this reason, it's not enough to simply design a cloud environment with

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.455
security in mind and deploy cloud resources with secure configurations.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:29.254
In the first few lessons we focused on designing cloud environments securely.

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:32.720
We now want to get a better sense of how to keep those environments

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.680
secure at all levels and through all phases of their life cycle,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.930
from development to production.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.050
The first step is to have visibility into what is

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.865
deployed or going to be deployed in your cloud environments.

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:48.890
Focus on three major categories,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.875
resources related to the management such as user roles and permissions,

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.640
network and infrastructure components,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.465
and your data, where is it and what does it contain?

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:04.070
How sensitive is it?

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.140
For each of these three categories,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.410
work with security and compliance teams to develop

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.265
a firm understanding of potential threats and vulnerabilities.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.880
Organizations and engineering teams should quantify

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.405
specific vulnerabilities that could increase risk and lead to exploitations.

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:28.190
The second key item is to ensure checks and processes are in place to scan for and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.820
identify vulnerabilities and configurations

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.035
which are not in line with security best practices.

00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:39.830
These processes should be automated and be capable of checking each part of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.560
the application stack from the code all the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.180
way down to the core cloud infrastructure services.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.400
When it comes to the cloud,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.900
some of the most obvious vulnerabilities are

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.010
server instances that are deployed without any OS hardening,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.600
exposure of secrets, overly permissive firewall rules,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.989
or overly permissive IAM policies.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.000
Identification of these types of vulnerabilities needs to happen during all phases of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.425
the life cycle starting from architecture design and code development,

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.375
all the way to post-production.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.480
Identification and remediation of vulnerabilities

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.455
earlier on drastically reduces risk of exploitation.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.320
We call this idea shift left.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.220
The principle's based on the idea that bugs found earlier in

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.165
the life cycle of a system or application are cheaper to fix.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:35.540
We can equate the cost of fixing a bug to the amount of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.185
risk and identified vulnerability poses to the system.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:43.490
For this reason, it is critical to always keep security in mind early

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.500
on when designing and developing your cloud environments and applications.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.655
Lastly, we want to be able to identify suspicious activities so that

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:57.100
active threats can be identified and remediated as soon as possible.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.230
It's important that security-related changes to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.940
the environment are also being monitored continuously.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.200
It's critical that tools and processes for defensive threat detection and

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.884
incident response be applied to all layers of the stack including user activity,

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:18.820
network traffic monitoring, and cloud configuration.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.710
Security monitoring tools should be implemented in all environments, not just production.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.260
As an architect, it is essential that you design

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.160
environments with the right tools in place for threat defense and monitoring.
