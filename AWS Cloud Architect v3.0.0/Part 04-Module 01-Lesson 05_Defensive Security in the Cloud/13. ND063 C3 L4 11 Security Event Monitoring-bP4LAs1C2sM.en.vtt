00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Now, that we have discussed some of the log and

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.370
event sources available in your Cloud environment,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.105
let's look at some methods to identify suspicious activity.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.180
AWS GuardDuty can monitor CloudTrail,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.500
DNS, and VPC flow logs to identify suspicious activity.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.520
A few examples of activity that GuardDuty can identify include SSH, brute-force attempts,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.280
or API calls from IP addresses that are on threat lists or traffic that is

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.730
destined for cryptocurrency-related IP addresses

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.810
from an EC2 instance in your environment.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.930
Log sources can be sent to SEIM tools for creating security dashboards.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.320
Many commercial tools have out of the box features to look at Cloud native logs,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.420
such as CloudTrail and VPC flow logs and identify anomalous activity.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.460
Example vendor tools include Splunk and sumo logic.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.590
CloudTrail logs can be sent to CloudWatch and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.505
custom alarms can be set up to monitor specific event types.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:06.680
An example use case for this is for an admin to be notified when a security group is

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.070
modified or the root user e-mail is used to login to the AWS account.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.660
Next, we will take a closer look at CloudTrail logs and GuardDuty finding types.
