00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.655
In this exercise, you were able to get a feel for how

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:08.590
AWS config can help identify vulnerabilities in your AWS account.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.925
I'll go through this exercise in my account by setting up some example config rules.

00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:17.470
So I have logged into my AWS account and

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.760
from the console page I will go to the AWS config service.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.480
Let's first check the settings for AWS config.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.640
As you can see, I have config recording on and I have

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.170
chosen to record only the S3 bucket resources.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.510
Let's take a look at my rules.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.755
I have added one rule to check for compliance.

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:46.310
This rule will check S3 buckets in my account to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.165
ensure that they have the server side encryption setting enabled.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:51.890
If I go into the rule,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.945
I can see details about which resources are out of compliance.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:01.055
I originally had a four buckets which were out of compliance.

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:04.670
So I had remediated the issue on two of those buckets,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.210
to ensure that they have default server-side encryption enabled.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.125
After having remediated the vulnerability,

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.750
the rule compliance change to compliant from non compliant.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.130
I can go to the newly compliant resource to see

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.560
the timeline and what specific configuration items may have changed.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.225
This shows my timeline and this is when

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:38.840
there was a change to put the resource in compliance.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.565
Let's see what changed.

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:48.920
As you can see, this bucket had server-side encryption enabled and went into compliance.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.620
AWS config is a powerful tool to track

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.590
configuration changes and compliance violations in your AWS account.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.499
I encourage you to explore the AWS config dashboard,

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.190
conformance packs, and rule aggregation features in more depth.
