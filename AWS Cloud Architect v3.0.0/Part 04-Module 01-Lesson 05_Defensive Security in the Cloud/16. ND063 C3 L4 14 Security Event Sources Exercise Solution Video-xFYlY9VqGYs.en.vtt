00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
In this exercise, your goal was to get a better understanding

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.950
of how to view user activity in AWS CloudTrail.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.030
I'm going to check CloudTrail in my account and show you how I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
searched for specific security-related events that are of interest to me.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.585
So in my AWS account,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.810
I'll go into the CloudTrail event history page.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.250
Here I would like to know when an S3 bucket encryption setting was changed.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.465
I can first search on resource type,

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:39.580
and here I will select S3 as my resource type.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.025
This will show me all actions related to S3 buckets in my account.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:51.450
Now, I can search for a specific event name in the filter.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.620
So I wanted to know when the encryption setting was

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.610
turned off on any S3 buckets in my account,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.390
so I'm going to search for the delete bucket encryption event name.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.110
So in the search results you can see that there were

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.420
three events which were the delete bucket encryption.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.860
I can expand the results and see details about each event.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.390
Notice I can see which user executed the action,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.510
what their source IP address was,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.235
and you're in which resource, which S3 bucket,

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:35.640
they perform the action on,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.015
and I can see a lot more details about the event if I need to.

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:49.649
I highly recommend that you use a combination of CloudTrail, AWS config, CloudWatch,

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.460
and other tools if possible to monitor

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.770
your AWS account for security-related changes to any of your resources.
