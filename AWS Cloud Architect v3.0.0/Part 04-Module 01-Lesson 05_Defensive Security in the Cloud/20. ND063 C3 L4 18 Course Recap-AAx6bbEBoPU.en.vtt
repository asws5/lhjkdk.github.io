00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
In this course, we introduced fundamental concepts to help you design,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.550
deploy, and run Cloud workloads with security in mind.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.435
We emphasized three critical design considerations,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:15.090
when it comes to architecting Cloud environments.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.200
First, we focused on accessing the Cloud management plane,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.855
and how to properly restrict who can do what in the Cloud.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:28.475
We investigated best practices for identity and permissions management in AWS.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:32.480
Secondly, you focused on ensuring security controls are put

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.505
in place with respect to gaining access to Cloud infrastructure,

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:39.575
Cloud Instances, and Cloud Private Networks.

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:42.770
The third core principle we looked at was ensuring that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.100
data stored in the Cloud is protected using encryption,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.525
and best practices around managing this encryption.

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:54.170
Lastly, we looked at techniques to defend Cloud applications from attack,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.120
and ensure that we have visibility into

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.540
the security posture and activity of our Cloud environments.
