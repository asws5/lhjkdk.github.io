00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Now I will go over the various types of vulnerability monitoring that is

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.620
recommended in Cloud environments and tooling options that can support this.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.980
When anything is setup, configured,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.000
or provisioned in a Cloud environment,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.639
ranging from infrastructure resources to platform services,

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:19.045
to identity and access policies,

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:21.965
it is important to verify that configurations

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:25.315
are in accordance with security best practices.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.615
If a configuration is out of compliance with security standards,

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:34.010
it needs to be identified as a vulnerability and remediated.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.635
A few basic examples of detecting and remediating vulnerabilities might include

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:46.010
discovery of an IAM role that uses a policy that allows admin access,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.275
and we can change the policy to be a least privileged policy.

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:55.170
Disk storage has been provisioned without volume encryption enabled.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.820
So we can work with teams to ensure that unencrypted disks are reprovisioned with

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.330
encryption or a server instance has been

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.115
created and configured to allow RDP connections from the public Internet.

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:14.094
So we can restrict RDP only to internal networks.

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:20.240
AWS Config provides checks that can help us identify these types of misconfigurations.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.800
AWS Config collects configuration snapshots of

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.284
many of the core infrastructure services that AWS provides.

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:30.460
When Config is enabled,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.699
you will have insight into how a particular resource is configured,

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:38.570
when it is changed and what was changed.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.110
The configuration snapshot serves as an input to rules which evaluate whether

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.570
the configuration is in compliance or out of

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.865
compliance with the conditions specified in the rule.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:54.520
Configuration snapshots can be processed by rules which evaluate whether

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.920
the configuration is in compliance or out of

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.930
compliance with the conditions specified in the rule.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.040
A basic example of a rule could be to identify

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.205
any security group that allows RDP access from

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:13.280
all IP addresses or 0.0.0.0/0 on port 3389.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.930
AWS provides a decent number of rules out of the box

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.850
which are based on standard security recommendation benchmarks.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.750
Rules can be set up to evaluate on configuration change or on a cron schedule.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.425
Since all rules are based on Lambda functions,

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:34.745
AWS provides the ability to create custom rules that evaluate

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:39.820
a specific criteria which may not be available as a rule out of the box.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.535
This also allows custom rules which can check compliance

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:47.585
of resources outside the folder of AWS Config.

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.560
Results of Config rules from multiple accounts can

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.490
also be sent to a central AWS account for analysis.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.315
It is strongly recommended to set up AWS Config rules for

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:03.985
any security or compliance requirements that your organization has.

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:07.760
Security Hub is a service within AWS which aggregates

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.040
findings from other security tools into a single pane of glass.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.015
Security monitoring services such as AWS Config, Inspector,

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:23.490
GuardDuty and many open source and commercial tools integrate findings with Security Hub.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.040
Security Hub can also be enabled to provide a tone key set of

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.075
Config rules that will check the AWS account against the CIS,

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:36.355
AWS foundations and PCI DSS checks.

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:40.955
Outside of AWS, there are many products that can integrate into

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.160
AWS accounts and monitor

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.395
the security and compliance posture of your AWS account level configuration.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:52.610
A number of open source products can perform one-time in-depth

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.550
checks and can also be set up to run on a regular cadence.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.655
Examples of open source tools include: Prowler,

00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:06.510
Scout2, CloudSploit, Cloud Custodian.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.500
Some commercial products which can also provide

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.754
monitoring of your Cloud security footprint include,

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:18.305
Fugue, Palo Altos, PRISMA Cloud, Cloud Conformity etc.

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.875
Many of these products provide a rich set of capabilities and features,

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:25.340
including real-time detection of configuration changes in

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.530
your Cloud environment and automatic remediation capabilities as well.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.140
Next, we will explore methods to identify

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.189
vulnerabilities within server and container-based Cloud workloads
