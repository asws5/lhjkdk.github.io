00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Security information and event management is

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.725
a fundamental pillar of information security.

00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:10.605
As you start operationalizing and deploying workloads to a cloud environment,

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.050
it is critical that there is insight into

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.160
activity and events related to cloud accounts or applications.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.430
It is important to have this monitoring in place,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.830
in order to identify any anomalous or suspicious activity in cloud accounts,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.485
servers, networks, and applications.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:33.675
Also to provide traceability for forensics and root cause analysis,

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:38.615
and auditability for access to sensitive data or actions.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.750
Let's look at some of the events sources available in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.490
AWS and methods to monitor these sources.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.775
Let's start with CloudTrail.

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:52.775
CloudTrail is the source of activity logging within an AWS account.

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.390
Any API activity, console usage,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.219
cross account access, etc,

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.850
will be recorded in CloudTrail.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.390
CloudTrail will log all activity and allow you to search these logs for 90 days.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.950
However, it is highly recommended to set up CloudTrail logs

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.525
in all accounts and all regions to be written to S3 buckets,

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:23.060
preferably to a central S3 bucket in a dedicated security account.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.180
These logs can then be examined later or

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.935
ingested by a log analysis or a SIEM tool such as Elasticsearch,

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.210
Splunk or Sumo Logic.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.320
CloudTrail is by far the most valuable tool to

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.895
monitor and audit activity in your AWS account.

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:46.205
CloudTrail provides many capabilities for saving and sending log events to other sources.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.515
When VPC Flow Logs are enabled,

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:52.480
you will have insight into some metrics related to network activity.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.825
For example, connection attempts, rejects,

00:01:55.825 --> 00:02:01.685
allows or denies, source and destination IPs and ports,

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.405
and packet and byte counts.

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:08.210
It is important to note that VPC Flow Logs do not provide

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
visibility into actual traffic content or payload.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.890
If you need visibility into network traffic content in order

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.235
to perform more sophisticated detection of activity,

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:22.045
you can enable VPC traffic mirroring.

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:25.130
Once VPC traffic mirroring is enabled,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.445
you can ship this data to third party network monitoring tools for further analysis.

00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:36.500
Any changes to an S3 buckets configuration will be logged as API calls by CloudTrail.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.290
But what about reading and writing data?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.990
From a security standpoint,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.760
it is important to be aware of attempts to read or write objects to S3 buckets,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.510
especially those that contains sensitive or critical data.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.170
Object level logging is optional and can be enabled either

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.664
through CloudTrail or the S3 bucket settings.

00:02:57.664 --> 00:03:02.230
All calls to read or write data can then be recorded through CloudTrail.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.545
S3 also provides an option to log calls to access objects

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:12.220
stored in S3 directly to a log file which resembles a web server access log.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.540
The benefit to using CloudTrail is that these read or write actions can be integrated

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.705
and monitored using the same methods that would be used to monitor the CloudTrail feed.

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:26.330
AWS Config logs record all state changes for

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.080
any resources that are being monitored by AWS Config.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.680
These logs can be sent to a log analysis tool to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.070
gain deeper visibility into configuration state changes.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.860
If using Route 53 for DNS,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.845
DNS Query logging is also available.

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.340
This can be useful if your security program needs to monitor

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.555
DNS queries for domains that are setup in AWS Route 53.

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:54.050
Regardless of your choice to enable DNS Query logging,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.485
AWS does maintain these logs behind the scenes,

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:00.685
and we'll use them for identifying suspicious activity.

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:04.160
Operating system and security logs are also critical

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.805
to identifying suspicious activity or auditing usage.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:12.200
These logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs or other log analysis tools

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.900
or products that provide intrusion detection

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.095
and dynamic host space security event monitoring.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:22.250
As you can see, there are many events sources to gain data from.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.670
You'll choose different sources to detect different events and gain new insights.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.520
Next, we'll look at how to monitor some of the data from these sources.
