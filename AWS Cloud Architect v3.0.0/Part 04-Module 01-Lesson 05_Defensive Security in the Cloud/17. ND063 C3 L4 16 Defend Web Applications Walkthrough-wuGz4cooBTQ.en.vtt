00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.790
Let's explore using the AWS WAF products to defend a web application.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.420
I have a simple website which is accessible via AWS CloudFront.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.930
I'm going to set up the AWS WAF to block any attempts

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.475
to exploit vulnerabilities that my web application may have.

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:21.775
So from the AWS console,

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.380
I'm going to go to the WAF service page.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.775
From this page, I'm going to create a new Web ACL.

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:32.810
A Web ACL is a collection of rules that will determine

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.995
the logic by which the WAF will allow or deny requests,

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:43.890
and that ACL is associated with one or more specific application endpoints.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.990
Somebody give my Web ACL a name.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.515
When setting up the Web ACL,

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:00.560
I will need to specify a resource types so that the WAF

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.035
knows that it is global or specific to a region.

00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:07.860
So if I choose CloudFront,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.639
the WAF will be applied to CloudFront which is a globally available resource.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.070
It's a different Web ACLs so I refresh the page.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.685
If I choose regional resources,

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.960
then I can put the WAF in front of resources such as API Gateway or

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.100
an EC2 application load balancer that I may have in my account,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.180
and I would have choose a region where they live.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.950
So I'm going to go back to CloudFront distributions

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.880
and I'm going to give my Web ACL a name.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.460
Now, I can choose which applications to associate the ACL with.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.815
So as you can see I have a list of CloudFront sites that I can choose from in my account.

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:06.550
So I'm going to choose the site.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.740
So next I will add an initial set of rules and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.950
decide what action to take if the requests don't match the rules.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.355
So I'm going to choose to use managed rule groups,

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:28.170
and as you can see I have a number of option for managed rule groups.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.855
AWS provides a set of rule groups and other vendors also provide.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:39.390
For example, Fortinet, Cyber Security Cloud, or GeoGuard.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.750
I'm going to go with the AWS managed rule groups set.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.090
I encourage you to get familiar with the different sets of managed rule groups.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.735
For the AWS managed rule groups I can basically turn them on or off.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:58.910
They're all off by default.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.900
For the other third party managed rule groups you're going to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.875
have to subscribe to them from the marketplace.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:11.150
So if I go into the AWS managed rule group like you see here,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.950
I'll choose one related to IP reputation.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.535
What this will do is it'll block any bot or

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:24.709
other traffic known by Amazon to becoming from threatening sources.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.605
So I'm going to have to explicitly enable it,

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:33.725
and if the rules action to count setting is set,

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:36.200
the rule is not going to block any traffic,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.760
it's just going to count any web requests that end up matching the rule.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.130
So I can also set the priority of rules.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.790
So if I have multiple rules that I've selected, I can order them.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.515
I can also set up CloudWatch metrics to see how many rules matched.

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:04.460
Another valuable feature when you have multiple accounts that

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.320
need to be defended is the AWS Firewall Manager.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.595
Now, AWS Firewall Manager allows you to set

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:17.645
organization-wide policies for the WAF and security groups.

00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:21.590
So in this way you can manage WAF policies and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.150
security groups centrally and apply them to other AWS accounts that you own or manage.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.380
I highly encourage DevOps and Cloud engineering teams to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.865
investigate this feature further to understand that the value it provides.

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:40.410
That wraps it up for this lesson.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.940
We've looked at a number of methods to ensure that your web applications are

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.990
protected when exposed to the wild and scary place we call the Internet.
