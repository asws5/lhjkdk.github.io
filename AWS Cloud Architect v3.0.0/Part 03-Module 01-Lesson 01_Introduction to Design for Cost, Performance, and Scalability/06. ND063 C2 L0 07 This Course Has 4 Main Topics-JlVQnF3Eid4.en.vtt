00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
This course has four primary topics.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.220
Our first two topics will be a comparison of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.330
cloud services to the on-premises model most of us are familiar with.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.640
For costs in the cloud,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.965
we will look at what services AWS charges for,

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:15.880
how costs are calculated,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.270
what you need to know to decide what infrastructure is appropriate for your technology,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.455
and how to optimize to get the lowest price for what you need to run successfully.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.615
In the performance in the cloud lesson,

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:29.075
we will explore optimized instances,

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:32.690
scaling, and how to optimize for improved performance.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.820
The serverless lesson will introduce you to

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.980
the AWS serverless technology offering and how they can impact performance and cost.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.160
Serverless is truly where the cloud differentiates itself from the on-premises model.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.465
In the infrastructure as code lesson,

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.680
we will begin to explore the idea that your entire enterprise can be defined in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.810
code and saved as files that can be used to deploy infrastructure in AWS.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.090
You'll start to learn the language of the cloud and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.925
begin to think of cloud solutions like an architect.

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:06.100
The work ahead is very exciting to me and I can't wait to get started.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.135
In this course, we will spend most of our instruction time in the AWS console.

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:12.890
In the first half of the course,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.790
we will be exclusively in the console working with AWS services to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.015
estimate costs and optimize performance.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:26.270
We will continue to do some work in the console as we explore AWS serverless technology,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.030
but we will get into a little bit of serverless code as

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.050
we explore possibilities with AWS Lambda.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.340
For the last lesson on infrastructure as code,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.070
we'll be working in an IDE and the command line to create and run our terraform files.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.580
AWS has over 100 services on their menu,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.865
and you can expect that number to grow and the interfaces to change over time.

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:55.865
They're always testing and pushing out new pages and dashboards.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.400
So you can expect that from time to time you will

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.505
log in and things won't look the same as the last time you checked in.

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.605
It's all in the name of progress,

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:06.890
so it's best to stay up-to-date on upcoming changes by

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.190
reading AWS blogs and watching their broadcasts on YouTube.
