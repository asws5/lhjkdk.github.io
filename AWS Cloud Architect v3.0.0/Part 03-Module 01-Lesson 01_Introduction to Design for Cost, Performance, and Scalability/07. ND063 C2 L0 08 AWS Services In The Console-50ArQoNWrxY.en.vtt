00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
I'm going to demonstrate logging in and browsing around the AWS management console.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.710
First one I'm going to do is browse to console.aws.amazon.com in my internet browser.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.505
This brings up my account, lesliecloudlab.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:19.620
I'm going to log in with my username,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.455
lesliecloudlab, and my password.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:26.130
After I successfully enter my username and password,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.385
AWS prompts me for my MFA code,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:34.350
which is a six digit code I'm retrieving from the Google Authentication app on my phone.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.985
After I login, I land here on the AWS management console page,

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:43.625
which lists some helpful shortcuts to frequently use services,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.905
some wizards, and some training videos.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:53.075
Note that I'm logged in to US East 1 or Northern Virginia.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.030
Selecting a region brings up a menu of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.315
regions that are available to me under my free tier.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:04.685
Next to region is the administrative menu that has my account information,

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:07.370
my billing dashboard, security credentials,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.365
and of course, the sign out link.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:10.910
Over here under support,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.350
we have some documentation,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.435
training, and other resources.

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:19.264
There are a couple of ways to get to the services you need in the AWS console.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:23.495
The most straightforward is to type the name or description into the search.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.810
Typing EC2 brings up the EC2 service,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.595
but so does typing instance and typing S3 brings up the S3 service,

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:33.295
but so does typing bucket.

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:39.215
The other way is to select the down arrow next to services on the menu ribbon here.

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:45.725
This brings up all of the AWS services available categorized by function.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:49.250
Feel free to get comfortable and use the option that works best

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.370
for you and then don't forget to log out.
