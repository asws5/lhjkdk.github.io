00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
When we talk about Cloud versus on-premises,

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.105
we're talking about the cloud as servers and resources

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.330
that are accessed over the Internet and on-premises as

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.900
hardware located onsite or in a data center running on hardware

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.055
that is owned or leased by and dedicated to one company.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:21.525
Cloud computing is generally categorized into four models.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.760
Private Cloud is compute resources deployed from one company organization,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.620
and that organization conducts mostly intra-business interactions and transactions.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.115
So it makes sense for them to own, operate,

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:37.130
and govern their own Cloud computing resources.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.860
Community Cloud is cloud resources that are

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.455
provided for organizations and community groups,

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:46.495
such as municipal groups, nonprofits, and schools.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:50.055
Hybrid Cloud combines public Cloud, private Cloud,

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:55.210
and Cloud on-premises to allow data and resources to be shared between them.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.890
Public Cloud is the cloud model generally used for business to consumer interactions.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.380
Public Clouds are owned by the government,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.730
academic institutions or business.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.490
Amazon.com Incorporated is the business that owns the public cloud, Amazon Web Services.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.115
Other examples of public Cloud providers are Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.150
Many large customers would like to take

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.955
advantage of the managed services the Cloud provides,

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:26.680
but regulations require them to maintain data onsite.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.710
AWS now has a unique hardware offering to meet their needs,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.605
while providing all the advantages of public Cloud.

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:38.120
Amazon recently announced a physical device called Amazon Outposts.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.065
Amazon Outposts resides on-premises in the data center as

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:46.580
AWS branded hardware comprised of fully managed compute and storage.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.180
This allows customers to run AWS compute and storage

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.595
on-premises and connect securely to the rest of Amazon's Cloud.

00:01:54.595 --> 00:01:58.790
Now, this goes against what most of us know to be true of the Cloud.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.420
That is, that it is massive data centers of compute and storage,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.915
running AWS services in a shared public model.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:08.900
What this shows is that AWS is able to be

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.465
flexible and innovate according to the requirements of the customers they serve.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:15.290
As a Cloud architect,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.265
you will be required to select the best Cloud model for your business needs.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:23.090
For this course, we will touch on hybrid architecture briefly,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.760
but a majority of our focus will be on public Cloud.
