00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
One of the primary business drivers for moving to

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.130
the Cloud is the potential for cost savings.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.010
But to be honest, motives abound.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.755
It's a major decision and a big move.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.570
In a large organization,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.995
the migration project plan might project that it'll take years to complete.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.745
My advice to you in this situation is to remain neutral and keep an open mind.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:24.530
What's important is that the team defines the goals

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.180
prior to planning the migration or fresh start in the Cloud.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.720
The team will generally consist of an IT director, IT managers,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.855
business application owners, the people with the money,

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:38.465
technical application owners and admins,

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.044
product managers, production engineers,

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:43.985
software engineering managers, software engineers,

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:46.760
infrastructure engineers, and specialized support

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.970
staff like monitoring engineers and level 3 and 4 support.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.640
Remember, you'll need to base your plans on

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.680
your baseline metrics to give your team the best shot at success.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.845
Some examples of your team's goals might be resiliency, elasticity, scalability,

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:07.760
fault tolerance and disaster recovery, high-performance,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.870
security, lower costs, centralization,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.620
and Cloud native applications.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.440
These are just a few examples.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.220
Your team goals will be different,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.660
but what's important is that you define them.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.945
Once you have a concrete set of goals documented and defined,

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:27.950
you need to associate each goal with your current data so you can

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.060
understand how to determine if your Cloud projects are performing on target,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.905
exceeding expectations, or if they need to be revisited and revised.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.980
You can use Amazon's monitoring services to capture

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.600
the metrics that will provide you with the data you need to make the best decision.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.970
There also a host of third party applications

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.230
designed to offer you every Cloud metric available and provides you with graphs,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.175
reports, and logs in a streamline format.

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:56.925
It's not necessary to use these applications,

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:58.790
but the way they interpret, aggregate,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.010
and present the data they capture can be of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.755
great use to team members who aren't as technical.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:08.780
It may lead to faster decision-making by drawing parallels and pulling out trends it may

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.880
take longer to detect when using the AWS built-in logging and monitoring options.
