00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Amazon disrupted the IT industry almost

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.255
15 years ago when they launched Amazon Web Services.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.390
The idea was to sell excess compute capacity

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.765
left over from their massive website, Amazon.com.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.620
They sold capacity by the hour and storage by the gigabyte.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.365
This on-demand, no contracts service also had a unique billing model.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:23.885
Cloud services are built like a utility,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.315
you pay as you go for what you use.

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:30.700
This billing model allows you to adapt to a changing IT landscape quickly,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.575
build out infrastructure according to your budget,

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.760
and make decisions based on your needs not your investments.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.530
While AWS appears to have taken the industry by storm with some companies seeing

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.730
the Cloud powerhouse as

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.735
the only logical choice to meet their complex technical infrastructure needs,

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.985
most of these organizations are using AWS Cloud inefficiently.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:56.150
It is common to find companies that started out in the Cloud years ago,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.775
found a configuration that met their needs,

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:03.080
set up a series of policies and procedures that made sense for them at the time,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.600
and they haven't made many changes since.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.935
A simple audit of their configuration has the potential to save them a lot of money,

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.605
but as in most cases in IT,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.395
inertia sets in, and along with that comes,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.825
if it isn't broken, don't fix it.

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:19.310
In cases like this,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.450
we might also find another cost issue that companies in the Cloud run into.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.630
Who's supporting the environment?

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.690
In the early stages of Cloud when it was only servers and switches,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.555
the support requirements could be met by any competent infrastructure engineer.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:36.570
In the ensuing years,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560
Cloud technology has evolved into its own practice,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.325
requiring dedicated technologists, policies, developers, and governance.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.540
Companies who started out in the Cloud long

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.450
ago and haven't kept pace with a technology upgrades and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.720
improvements may also find that they don't have the right people on

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.650
the team to help them take advantage of everything the Cloud has to offer.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.060
This course will offer broad descriptions of public Cloud in general,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.325
but the primary focus will be on the technology provided by Amazon Web Services.

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:12.845
In this course, I may use AWS and Amazon interchangeably,

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:18.080
but please note that Amazon.com Incorporated is the parent company of AWS,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.380
and owns other organizations such as Amazon.com,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.299
the global e-commerce website,

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.095
Prime Video, Twitch, Ring, and whole foods.

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:30.560
Generally, when I say Amazon,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.250
I mean AWS, the Cloud provider.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.590
AWS changes frequently, so that what you see in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.969
this course may not match what you see when you access AWS yourself.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.720
What you see in this course reflects how the AWS management console

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.130
looks and how AWS functionality works in March of 2020.
