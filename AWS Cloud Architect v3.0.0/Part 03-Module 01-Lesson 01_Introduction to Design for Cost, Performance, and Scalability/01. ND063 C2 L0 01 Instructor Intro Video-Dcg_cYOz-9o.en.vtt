Hello, and welcome to course two of the Cloud Architecture Nanodegree.

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:06.990
It's nice to have you here.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm Leslie, a Cloud Architect and Disaster Recovery Specialist from Chicago.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.744
Like some of you who are changing careers,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:17.070
I didn't begin my career in IT.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.040
I'm actually a chemist who learns server technology on

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.315
the job while working on a network data system at a life sciences company.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.120
I've been a Cloud Architect for about five years,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.165
and I've enjoyed every technology challenge and triumph along the way.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm excited to be here sharing cloud technology lessons and guiding you through

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.790
the beginning stages of what I'm sure will be

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.210
exciting and rewarding careers in cloud architecture.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.100
The goal of this course is to provide you with the foundation you need to draw

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.620
the necessary parallels between what we know

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.330
as traditional on-premises data center and the public cloud.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.890
So that you can properly provisioned the resources in

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.100
the cloud necessary for successful cloud deployments
