00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
This course content discusses high-performance in the Cloud,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.425
which is not to be confused with high performance computing in the Cloud.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:11.250
High performance computing is also known as supercomputing,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.845
and the terms can be used interchangeably.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.845
High performance computing is a process of

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.010
aggregating computer power and harnessing all of that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.115
compute potential to solve large and complex problems

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:26.560
in fields like medicine, engineering, and finance.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.835
Problems that would take hours, weeks,

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:30.485
or even years on a desktop,

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:31.985
only take minutes, days,

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:33.965
and weeks on a supercomputer.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:38.935
They sustain high-performance by using each nodes computing resources concurrently.

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:43.970
Computers or nodes are organized into groups called clusters and configured

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.070
to communicate and work together through software managed communication networks.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.569
As you can imagine,

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.290
managing clusters with hundreds of nodes is a big job that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.445
requires personnel with specialized IT knowledge and experience.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.245
In a research environment,

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:05.195
you won't find many scientists with a time and desire to manage the supercomputer.

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:08.305
They really want to focus on their area of study.

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:12.320
Amazon has a managed supercomputer service that matches

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.200
utilization needs to run the most compute intensive workloads.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000
This isn't a course on high performance computing

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.980
and we'll only be touching on it briefly.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.429
But it needs to be included in the conversation about performance in the Cloud,

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.920
because supercomputing really is the ultimate and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.010
highly scaled ultra high performance computing in the Cloud.
