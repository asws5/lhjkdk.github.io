00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.515
Now that you are familiar with the concepts we will be covering in this course,

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:06.450
please take the time to make sure you are

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.510
prepared by reviewing the requirements checklist.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.360
You'll need access to the AWS console, an IDE,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
the AWS command-line interface,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.640
and application you'll feel comfortable using to create an architecture diagram,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.265
and you'll need to install Terraform.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:30.750
I provided links to everything you need in the checklist in the previous section.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.610
Now that we have everything we need to complete

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
our project and lesson exercises, let's get started.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.340
Taking the steps to further your education and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.265
learn more about Cloud architecture is courageous.

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:44.960
The field of Cloud architecture has evolved from simple computer storage

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.210
15 years ago to supercomputers and machine learning today.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.870
Cloud providers are offering more services and configurations than ever,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.360
giving customers infinite options when it comes to technology solutions.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760
Give yourself the space to absorb it all and allow yourself

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.374
the freedom to imagine all the possibilities Cloud computing provides,

00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:09.520
and how it can potentially improve a technology obstacle you've been thinking about.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.275
Most of all, give yourself time to integrate and comprehend the lessons.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.820
Read the articles and watch the videos at the end

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.540
of the modules for greater depth of understanding.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.570
Mastery of the Cloud is much closer than you think.
