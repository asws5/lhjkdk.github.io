00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code software tool.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.560
It facilitates the replacement of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.640
manual provisioning and the configuration process with code,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.305
saving time and money.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.540
Terraform was developed in

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.280
the Go language by a company called HashiCorp about six years ago,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.065
and it has recently gained wide acceptance and adoption in production environments,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.660
and mostly at tech forward companies that can

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.254
afford to attract and pay talented engineers,

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.150
to interpret and condense their entire infrastructure,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.160
tens of thousands of servers and services globally into terraform files and modules.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.925
Terraform code is written in HashiCorp configuration language or HCL.

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:49.235
A structured configuration language that is human and machine readable,

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.960
for use of the command line,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.825
and primarily for IT automation.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.740
Terraform unifies the view of your Cloud resources in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.810
a file or a group of files organized into modules,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.355
and Terraform is Cloud neutral,

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:10.070
meaning the API provides does not let the user to any one particular Cloud provider.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.145
Code written for Terraform is portable,

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:16.175
and with some small auditable changes,

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:21.625
can be modified to recreate infrastructure quickly in multiple Cloud environments.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:26.585
Now, Terraform is not exactly an introductory Cloud architecture topic.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.430
It is easy to learn.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.970
So this introductory lesson is important because infrastructure

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.845
as code is such as sought-after skill in modern cloud environments.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:39.005
It's important for you to be familiar with what it is,

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.355
how it works, and why it's so powerful.

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:45.995
Architects with Terraform expertise are in high demand.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:49.880
So I would encourage you to continue learning about infrastructure as code,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.720
as a supplement to your current Cloud studies in career aspirations.
