00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Like most modern programming languages,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.225
Terraform language uses the concept of variables.

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:11.385
Variables are commonly stored in either a variables.tf file,

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:16.380
or terraform.tfvars file in a Terraform configuration.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.995
Terraform variables can be input variables or output variables.

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:26.070
You would use a variables.tf file to define

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
the variables type and optionally set a default value.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.670
A terraform.tfvars file is used to set the actual values of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.600
the variables or you can set

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.845
default values for all your variables and not use tfvars files at all.

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:46.070
Input variables are used to make your code more

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.380
configurable by allowing you to send values into Terraform,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.235
while output variables, as the name implies,

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:59.455
output or print an expression from Terraform.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:04.910
An example of an input variable is a port number for file transfer.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.720
The variable is a transfer port number defined in

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.145
a tfvars file and stored in the variable transfer port.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:17.585
So anytime you need to specify the transfer port in the configuration,

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.990
you will substitute var.transfer_port.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.290
Once you define your variables in the tfvars file,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.620
you can use them in multiple locations in your Terraform code,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.440
which is very convenient.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.150
Output variables follow the same steps.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410
A good example of an output variable is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.275
the IP address of a server in your environment that Terraform is aware of.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.315
When designing Terraform configurations,

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:48.655
it is very important to keep the re-usability of the code in mind.

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:51.520
Defining values as variables,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.965
allows configurations to be more dynamic because

00:01:54.965 --> 00:02:00.810
each individual value doesn't need to be hard-coded in the Terraform configuration.
