00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.425
Welcome back. Here's my solution to the creating an RDS database from the CLI exercise.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:11.355
So what we have here from the command line are all of our commands,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.235
AWS, RDS, create db instance.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.725
We've allocated 20 gigs of storage.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:21.135
The instance class that we've specified as dbT2 micro,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:26.010
the identifier, the name of our database is going to be udacity-cloudlab.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.680
It's a Postgres database and we've got our username and our password.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.935
So with that, we're going to go ahead and run it.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.810
Okay, that looks pretty good.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.100
So we're going to switch over to our console and see that our database that we named in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.140
the command line to udacity-cloudlab is still in the process of being created.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.400
So even though it's in the process of being created, that's okay.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.720
We can still go ahead and delete it because we don't want

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.510
to accumulate excess charges unnecessarily.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.130
So we're going to come back over to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.025
the command line and we're going to run the following command,

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:06.439
aws rds delete db instance and db instance identifier,

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.225
which is udacity-cloudlab, and then we're going to skip the final snapshot.

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:14.100
Let's go ahead and run that. That looks pretty good.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.710
So if we go back over to the RDS Management page and hit refresh here.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.885
Give this a little time.

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.230
We'll see there are database that we just

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.725
created from the command line is now being deleted.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:37.440
Thank you so much for completing the exercise.
