00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Hello again and for the last time.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:05.880
Congratulations on making it this far.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.120
Here's what we learned over the last few lessons.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.375
We started out looking at costs in the cloud,

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.465
and how to monitor and optimize them.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.675
Next, we looked at performance,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.695
starting with scaling and then taking a deep dive into storage,

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.290
archive, and database options.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.845
We also looked at message queues and networking.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.065
In the serverless lesson,

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:34.900
we discussed cloud migration in AWS Lambda.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.110
We also looked at the cost of serverless and learned that,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.670
in the right situation,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.940
using serverless can bring huge cost savings.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.910
We also looked at API Gateway, DynamoDB, and containers.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.195
Finally, in our last lesson,

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:56.240
we talked about infrastructure as code and got

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.835
an overview of Terraform and IaC best practices.

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:06.604
Thank you for taking the time to walk with me through the essentials of AWS Cloud costs,

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:10.265
performance, serverless, and IaC.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.610
If this nanodegree program has been your first exposure

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.940
to the AWS public cloud and cloud architecture,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.050
I hope you're starting to gain an understanding of cloud compute potential and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.570
how to compare and contrast the cost and performance to that of the data center.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.575
This has been an introduction to dozens of cloud concepts and services.

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:37.420
As you know, technical concepts build on each other and take time and experience to grow.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.610
You've taken the first big step to acquiring the skills

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.345
required to be a cloud cost and performance champion,

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:46.594
and I commend you for your decision.

00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:48.260
When you have time,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.290
read the articles and watch the videos provided at the end of

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.480
the lessons to deepen your understanding of cloud resource management.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.820
You may be surprised how quickly your beginner efforts and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.365
knowledge become advanced understanding and expertise.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.020
It's been a pleasure walking through these lessons

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.120
with you and I look forward to meeting and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.070
interacting with some of you in the future in

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.740
your careers as cloud architects and engineers.
