00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.065
Here's how I completed the exercise to use S3 as a remote backend for terraform.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:10.230
So as we know, the goal of this exercise is to end up

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.860
with four different versions of terraform.tfstate.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.770
So in order to do that,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.175
we're going to use the same files,

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:21.870
main.tf and backend.tf that we were

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.490
using before and we're just going to make some modifications.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.600
So to main.tf, we're just going to add four t2.small

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.770
instances that won't be that big a deal and we're going to keep the same backend.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.870
The reason we're doing this is because we want to use

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.140
the same state file and we're going to change

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.900
the state of the environment twice so that we

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.170
have two more versions of terraform.tfstate.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.195
So those two files are saved.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:52.535
Let's go on over to our terminal and of course,

00:00:52.535 --> 00:01:01.830
initialize our directory and terraform plan.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.770
It's going to add four new instances.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.065
That's great. Terraform apply.

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.860
So this is going to get us one more version of

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.520
terraform.tfstate because the state of the infrastructure is changing,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.620
there are going to be four more instances running.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.830
So it's creating those four instances.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.310
So let's just go and check and see if we've

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.955
got our third version yet. We'll give it a minute.

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:42.970
While we're doing that, there's nothing wrong with going and checking and

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.060
seeing how our EC2 instances are cooking.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.210
This should be four small instances coming up,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.490
there we go, two here and then two here.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.495
Two small, two small.

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:05.735
So since those are in a running state,

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:12.730
let's have a look at our terraform.txt file.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.640
Let's just show our versions,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.370
brand new version that we just got.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.040
Let's go for version four by going back to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:40.360
our terminal and terraform destroy.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.470
So we're changing the state of our infrastructure again and we're going to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.930
get another version of terraform.tf state.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.160
There go our four, t2 small instances.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:13.690
Given a moment to process and let's have a look and see if we've got four versions.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.770
There we go. Four versions of terraform.tf state.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.465
Our third version when we created our instances and our new one,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.630
the latest version, when we just destroyed those four instances.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.640
Thank you guys for completing the exercise.
