00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
I'd like to show you how to create an EC2 instance from the command line.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.370
So what we're going to do first is verify that we've got

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.460
the AWS CLI installed properly by typing in the command which aws.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.215
So if we run that command,

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.605
it shows us where the AWS CLI is installed,

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:24.735
and after that if we'd like to just verify the version that we have running,

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:29.950
we type in aws--version

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.860
and it returns that we we're running AWS CLI version 2.0 and that's great.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.450
So what we do next is we run the commands for creating

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.740
an EC2 instance and I've already got those here. It's already here.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.460
So what I want to do is show you how you gather

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.910
this information that's required in order to create your instance.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.510
So the first command is aws

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.615
ec2 run-instances and the first command it wants image id.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:06.690
Next it wants how many instances to create,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.705
the instance type, your key name,

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:11.990
security group id, and subnet id.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.735
So first let's go find the AMI id that we're going to use.

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:18.630
We're going to find that here.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630
When we go to launch an instance,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.690
we select the first Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.580
The AMI id that we want is right here.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.555
What I normally do is I just select it,

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:33.085
and copy, and paste it right into my terminal.

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.250
So next, it wants count,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.630
we just want to create one instance,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.475
if you want four, count four.

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:40.340
Instance type t2 micro,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.720
we're all familiar with that.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.420
That's the free tier EC2 instance.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.240
The key name, that's our PEM file that we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.210
download in order to interact with EC2 instances.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.550
You should have already downloaded your PEM file by now.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.250
All it wants to know is that the name of your PEM file and your PEM file needs

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.510
to be saved in whatever directory you're running the AWS CLI from.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.030
So if you need to copy it from your downloads over to your home directory,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.275
then go ahead and do that.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:13.835
Security group, let's go find the security group id that is looking for,

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:19.255
we're going to find security group under VPC.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:23.300
So under security, find security groups

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.760
here and I'm selecting the default security group.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.925
So I'm going to select it and then down here,

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:35.180
just hit this copy to keyboard icon,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.280
and then just return to your terminal and paste it.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.050
Subnet id, same thing,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.550
we're just going to go back to our management console and we know that

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.085
our subnets are also under our VPC and all of our subnets,

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:56.080
at least all my subnets are in us-east-1.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.740
So it doesn't matter which one I select,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.530
these are all default subnets.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.585
Just select one, come on down here and click copy to keyboard,

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:10.385
return to your terminal and paste your subnet id right there.

00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:12.890
After you have all of your information here in

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.160
the command line that you need in order to create your EC2 instance,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.685
you can just go ahead and run it.

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:22.230
So it looks like we were successful.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.115
So let's just switch back over to our management console EC2,

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:33.090
and we should see a new EC2 instance.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.120
Probably it would be in the initializing phase.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.185
Sure enough, we have one EC2 instance that's initializing,

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:44.060
and just to verify it's the right one,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.280
let's just scroll on over.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.930
Yeah, that's the one.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.530
So we can just wait here for it to go to

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.500
a running state after it passes its status checks.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.415
Great, successful.

00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:09.535
So we have an EC2 instance now that's up and running in us-east-1b availability zone,

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:12.095
and we created it from the command line.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.790
So thanks for watching.
