00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
Let's take a look at Terraform commands.

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:10.464
So first what I'm going to do is I'm going to browse into my Terraform directory,

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:16.440
go ahead and type in which Terraform,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.460
and that's going to show you the directory where Terraform is installed.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.295
Then from there, go ahead and type in Terraform,

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.415
and what you'll see here on the display is a list of

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:33.795
common commands like apply and destroy which you'll get familiar with,

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:39.150
and then plan providers and then some other miscellaneous commands.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.860
So Terraform apply builds infrastructure,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.220
Terraform initializes your Terraform directory,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.325
Terraform tears down or destroys the infrastructure you create with Terraform, etc.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:56.674
So from here let's browse into,

00:00:56.674 --> 00:01:00.170
well, what we know is one of our working directories.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.535
So Udacity, I got one called S3.

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:09.380
So Udacity S3, we're going to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.690
initialize this directory with one of our Terraform command.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.995
So let's try it, terraform init.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:21.140
Great. So we see we have a message that Terraform has been successfully initialized.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.860
Let's do one more command. Let's try Terraform plan.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.910
Running Terraform plan, since

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.004
Terraform are to look at the.TF files that are in that directory,

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.290
it reads them, it interprets them,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.660
and then it lists out based on what's in those TF files what it's going to do.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.110
Great. Thanks for watching.
