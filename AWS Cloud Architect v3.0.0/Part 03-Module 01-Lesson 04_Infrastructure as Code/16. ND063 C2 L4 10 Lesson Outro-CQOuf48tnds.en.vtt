00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
We've made it to the end of our lesson on infrastructures as code.

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.880
So let's take a look at what we learned.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.915
Well, first we learned about what infrastructure as code is,

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:11.445
and when it's helpful.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.590
Then we talked about terraform and how we can use it to design and deploy infrastructure.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
We talked about terraform collaboration and security.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.510
Finally, we went through some best practices for using infrastructure as code.
