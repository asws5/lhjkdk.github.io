00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
Let's take our first look at creating infrastructure using Terraform.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.025
So here I am in my terminal and I'm in my Terraform directory.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:09.600
If you want to know where that is,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.680
you just type in which terraform and it'll show you where your Terraform directory is.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.960
So inside my Terraform directory,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.680
I've created a Udacity_EC2 directory

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.860
that we're going to use today to create our infrastructure.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.530
So I'm just going to get into that directory,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.570
and this is going to be our Terraform working directory for this exercise.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.215
So what I want to do here is

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:41.565
terraform init and initialize this back-end. So that's great.

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:43.425
So now that Terraform's initialized,

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:47.870
I'm going to go ahead and move over to our code editor.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.360
Let's take a look at RTF file that we're going to use to create an EC2 instance today.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.739
So as we discussed we've got our provider,

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.530
our access key, and secret key,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.995
which were downloaded as a CSV file from AWS,

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.560
and I've selected my region, us-east-1.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.074
So the resource I'm going to create is an AWS instance.

00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:15.695
I've selected the AMI that goes along with Amazon Linux 2,

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:19.815
and t2 micro, we're going to keep it in the free tier.

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:22.125
So you save that.

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:26.140
Let's get back over to the terminal.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.570
Again, just because I just saved that file again,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.580
I'm going to initialize the directory again,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.690
and then we're going to run terraform plan and that's going to show us,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.500
based on our main.tf file,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.315
what Terraform thinks we're asking it to do.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:50.375
So and it's right, one to add,

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.280
zero to change, zero to destroy.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.930
Add one t2 micro instance.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.085
So that looks good, terraform apply.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:09.855
It's going to ask us to confirm here,

00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:17.720
type yes and it's going to go ahead and create our instance for us.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.270
So let's move over to the AWS management console.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.330
I wanted you guys to take a look here at Identity and Access Management.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.770
If you can't find your access keys to create the infrastructure,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.780
you can go ahead and create some new ones.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.935
It's not a big deal,

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.705
you just come in here under your user account,

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:43.090
under security credentials, and you just need to create new access keys.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.430
So there were some access keys I couldn't find,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.210
so I just went ahead and made some new ones,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.920
and you just make this one inactive or you can delete it.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.160
Then when you do that,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.750
it's going to download a CSV file,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.160
but it's also going to pop up a window.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.690
You can copy your keys from either place.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.280
But I digress.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.850
Let's go over then look at EC2 and see if our instance

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.390
that we just created with Terraform is up and running.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.770
Almost there, so this is the instance that we just

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.580
created and it's in the initializing stage.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.230
So let's go ahead and let that come

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.390
into a full running state after it passes its status checks.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.080
Great. It passed its status checks,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.980
we have a fully up and running EC2 instance that we created with Terraform.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.374
So now let's go back to our terminal and we are going to terminate that instance,

00:03:57.374 --> 00:04:03.490
and the way we do that is terraform destroy.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.920
Terraform wants us to know if we're really serious about this,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.360
and we're going to say yes we are.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.085
It's going to start the process of terminating our instance.

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:19.390
So let's go back over here to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:30.125
the EC2 management page and our instance should be shutting down now,

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:38.820
and momentarily it will enter a terminating state.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.190
It stopped and it's soon to be terminated.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.320
So that's how you create and destroy infrastructure using Terraform.
