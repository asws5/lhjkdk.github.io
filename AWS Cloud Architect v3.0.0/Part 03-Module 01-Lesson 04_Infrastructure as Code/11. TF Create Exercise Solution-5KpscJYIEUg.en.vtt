00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Here's how I completed the creating infrastructure with Terraform exercise.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.340
Again, first, I want to make sure that I'm in the right directory,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.975
so I'm going to type which Terraform.

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:15.960
That's going to show me that, yes,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.295
I'm in the right directory.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:22.410
I'm in my Udacity EC2 directory in the Terraform route.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.770
The next thing I'm going to do is initialize Terraform init. Looks good.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.750
Now let's go on over here to our code editor and take a look

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.080
at the modifications that you guys made to the code for this exercise.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.390
What we asked you to do, is add a count of two instances,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.205
change the instance type,

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:50.195
and tag it with a name of Udacity Terraform.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.260
That looks good. So now let's head over to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.169
our terminal and see what Terraform has planned.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:11.085
I'm going to add two instances, so Terraform apply.

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:14.385
I'm going to go ahead and give our consent here.

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:21.325
Now let's switch on over to our management console.

00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:23.950
Hit Refresh and see what's cooking.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.740
Yes, we've got our two instances that are coming up now, T_2 small.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.330
If we take a look at our tags,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.820
Udacity Terraform's our key,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.675
our name, our value, Udacity Terraform.

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:46.420
That looks pretty good. So we're in a pending state.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.710
Once they get to a running state,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.060
we'll go ahead and go back to our terminal and destroy them.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.365
Perfect, right on time.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:02:04.420
Let's go back and Terraform destroy. We'll agree to that.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.870
Have another look here and

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.325
our two new T_2 small instances should be on their way out here.

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.585
Which is important to know,

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:20.165
because we are running T_2 small instances just for this short period of time.

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.810
These two instances are not in the free tier.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.810
So we want to make sure that we get right back over to Terraform

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.139
and run Terraform destroy and terminate these instances.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.030
Thank you for completing the exercise.
